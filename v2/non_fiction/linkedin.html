        After nearly two decades of using LinkedIn, I have to
        move on.  It turns out LinkedIn now only supports
        posting "rich" content (images, etc.) via browsers
        running on Windows clients.  People who remember the
        "bad old days" of Microsoft will like find this return
        to Walled Gardents <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>
        distressing.  "The Web" was a delightful accident, but
        by the time we figured out it's potential, the idea of
        an OS-Neutral platform for content creation and
        distribution enabled a constellation of highly regarded
        web sites and applications.

        It's not you, Microsoft.  It's me.  I've been through
        this before.  I don't want to go through it again.
