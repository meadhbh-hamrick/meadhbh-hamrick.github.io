        So there i was at Camp Pendleton walking down the
        hill toward San Onofre. For two weeks our training
        platoon had been walking up and down hills with
        increasingly heavy loads and stopping every now and
        again to shoot imaginary bullets at imaginary
        threats.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a lot of fun for the first few days; rolling
        around in the mud, playing G.I. Joe. Heck, i even
        enjoyed mapping terrain features on the map with
        actual terrain features in front of me. "Whoo Hoo!
        Look at me! I'm a tool using mammal with my map and
        my radio and my M16A2 service rifle!"
      </p>

      <p>
        The first time you eat a Chicken a la King MRE
        (Meal-Ready-to-Eat), it's not that bad. They came
        with a sawdust and wax cake which was mysteriously
        labeled "fruitcake," but it was okay, the wax
        chocolate substitute candy bar made up for any
        displeasure the fruitcake caused. And don't get me
        started with how much of a fruitcake i had to be to
        agree to enlist in the marines.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second Chicken a la King MRE you eat is still
        not that bad. It's appropriately salty and kind of
        filling. for a packet of goo with peas and carrots,
        it's really pretty good.
      </p>

      <p>
        But somewhere between the third and fourth Chicken
        a la King MRE, you realize you want to kill
        something. At first I thought they must have
        slipped some uber-androgen in the fruitcake, but it
        was okay, I would survive.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the fourth day of marching up and down the hill,
        shooting blanks at invisible communists and
        subsisting exclusively on chicken a la king MREs, I
        realized it probably wasn't some uber-androgen
        infused fruitcake that made me want to kill, but
        rather the knowledge that the sadistic bastards in
        charge of this platoon made sure that the only
        meals we got for two weeks were Chicken a la King
        MREs.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was still rational enough I didn't want to kill
        our drill instructors. No... that wouldn't
        work. But i did want to kill something. and that's
        sort of the beauty of the Marine NCO corps; they
        had elevated simple dickishness to a hilariously
        absurd system of ensuring mission readiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Marine training is an excellent exercise in applied
        psychology. I don't know if they teach this to
        their instructors or simply select instructors who
        are simply excellent dicks. I'm not sure it
        matters, really. Every bit of marine training is
        there to push you off balance in some
        way. Everyone's heard how the marines strip down
        your individual identity in order to rebuild it in
        the group mold. But they rarely tell you how
        imaginative they can be while doing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In platoon 3051's case, it was Chicken a la
        King. after four days of constipation and eating
        chicken flavoured goo, i was ready to kill
        something. And that's how we lived for two
        weeks. March. March. March. Run. Run. Run. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Clean. Clean. Clean. With
        random breaks for collective punishment for
        infractions i'm now pretty sure never happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        For two weeks we were out in the sticks getting
        stressed and eating cold, relatively crappy
        goo. And then five hundred yards from San Onofre
        the yelling stops and you're marched right up to
        mess hall and politely called in one squad at a
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        After two weeks in the sticks the first thing you
        do when you get back to "civilization" is get a
        warm meal. You don't hit the shower. You don't even
        drop off your pack at the barracks; some random
        person is assigned to watch everyone's gear where
        it's stacked up in the parking lot.
      </p>

      <p>
        You literally walk in from the woods where you're a
        pissed off wild-man directly into the mess hall. I
        don't remember what they were serving that day (it
        might have been steak & lobster.) What i remember
        is the music. For the first time in three weeks i
        heard music. It was the Strawberry Alarm Clock's
        "Incense and Peppermints."
      </p>

      <p>
        It's really only a series of self-referential
        meaningless lyrics. But separate a kid from the
        burbs from pop music for a couple weeks and it hit
        me with the force and fury of a Verdi opera or a
        Beethoven symphony.
