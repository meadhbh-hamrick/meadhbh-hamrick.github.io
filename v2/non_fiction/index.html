        It turns out I have a few stories that aren't
        really fiction and don't count as technical.

        When I was a kid, a series of bad decisions led me
        to be join the US Marine Corps. The Marines are
        widely misunderstood. We're not blood-thirsty
        killers all the time. We're not wooden soldiers
        ready to die at a moment's notice. Mostly we're
        like a fraternity that has the legal right to kill
        people. Like many of my peers, my service in the
        Marine Corps was "average" -- I wasn't going to win
        any medals for being gung-ho, but my comrades also
        wouldn't single me out as being a self-serving
        dick. I wrote a few vignettes about the hilarious
        danger of the corps and put them here.
