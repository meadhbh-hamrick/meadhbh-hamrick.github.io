        It turns out I have a few stories that aren't
        really fiction and don't count as technical.

        When I was a kid, a series of bad decisions led me
        to be join the US Marine Corps. The Marines are
        widely misunderstood. We're not blood-thirsty
        killers all the time. We're not wooden soldiers
        ready to die at a moment's notice. Mostly we're
        like a fraternity that has the legal right to kill
        people. Like many of my peers, my service in the
        Marine Corps was "average" -- I wasn't going to win
        any medals for being gung-ho, but my comrades also
        wouldn't single me out as being a self-serving
        dick. I wrote a few vignettes about the hilarious
        danger of the corps and put them here.

        I suspect I will never be known for my witty aphorisms
        like Nietzsche and Pascal.  But hope springs eternal:

      </p>

      <ul>

        <li><a href="hammer.html">Law of the Shitty
          Instrument</a> - You might think this is about poorly
          designed tools, like Windows.  But it's more about
          choosing the wrong mental model to evaluate a
          problem.
        </li>

        <li><a href="repo.html">(Don't Fear) the Repo</a> - If
          you use a decent branching strategy, test frequently
          and use deploy flags, there's no reason you should
          fear checking incomplete or unreleased features into
          git.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Also, a few words about why I left LinkedIn.
