        It's no secret RISC-V is getting big. The spec's
        are open, no one charges a royalty for the
        privilege using the instruction set and some of
        the RISC-V chips people are making are positively
        tiny.
      </p>

      <p>
        The biggest problem I see with RISC-V is
        existing documentation is intended for chip
        designers. That's no great shock, I suppose.
        David Patterson, the godfather of RISC-V, is a
        very well regarded chip design researcher.

      <p>
        Some online forums recommend you read Patterson
        and Hennessy's <em>Computer Organization and
        Design</em> before even thinking about reading
        the RISC-V specs. And there's some wisdom in that
        advice. For the past ten years of online
        discussions, most of the people in the RISC-V
        community have taken upper division or graduate
        classes on chip design. The RISC-V specs are
        largely intelligable to mere mortals, but much of
        the online commentary assumes you took
        Patterson's computer architecture course.

      <p>
        The articles here are for "mere mortals." They're
        for people who know C and aren't frightened of
        assembly language. There are plenty of people
        who need to know the basics of what goes on
        under the hood on a RISC-V system, but don't have
        time to return to school to get an EE degree from
        Berkeley.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the articles here are "byte sized." No need
        to invest hours in monolithic reading jags. Read
        an article or two. If you don't like it, you
        haven't sunk too much into it.
