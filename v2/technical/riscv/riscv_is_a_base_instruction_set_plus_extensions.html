        This is a brief, informal introduction to the
        RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture. For the
        official description, you'll want to see the

      <h2>A Bit of History and Business Perspective</h2>
      
      <p>
        Let's start with the most basic question, "What
        is RISC-V?"
      </p>

      <p>
        RISC-V is a family of specifications describing
        an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). While
        there are several chips which implement the
        RISC-V instruction set, the chips themselves are
        not "RISC-V." They may implement the RISC-V
        specifications, but they themselves are not
        "RISC-V." This is a similar to the ARM™ and
        MIPS™ processor architectures; the names "ARM"
        and "MIPS" refer to the description of the
        architecture and not to any one particular
        implementation. Like ARM and MIPS (and POWER and
        SPARC), there are several different
        implementations from multiple companies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike ARM, MIPS and POWER, there's no fee for
        using the RISC-V specifications to create (and
        sell) your own implementation. If you've heard
        one thing about RISC-V, it's probably that it's
        an "Open Source Instruction Set Architecture."
        This doesn't mean RISC-V chips are cost-free; it
        just means that you're free to download the free
        RISC-V specification(s) and use them. No one's
        going to come around trying to collect a fee for
        an architecture license.
      </p>

      <p>
        But building chips is expensive. Most chips are
        designed using customized tools that took
        hundreds (if not thousands) of man-months to
        develop. For companies that design chips, these
        tools are the corporate "crown jewels." This is
        the software that makes it easy to rapidly
        iterate on new designs when adding features or
        fixing bugs so it's no surprise companies guard
        this software jealously.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the RISC-V team went the other way. Instead
        of making their design software proprietary,
        they open sourced it. The "Rocket Chip
        Generator" <a href="#ref_6">[6]</a> software
        takes a specification for a RISC-V processor and
        outputs Verilog describing a working RISC-V
        core. System developers can then take that
        Verilog and use it for simulation or synthesis.
      </p>

      <p>
        And remember, the specifications and many tools
        are open-source. Google took the Rocket Chip
        Generator, forked it, added some enhancements and
        published it back as the BottleRocket RV32IMC
        Core <a href="#ref_7">[7]</a>. And a slightly
        different team from UC Berkeley published tooling
        to generate BOOM : The Berkeley Out-of-Order
        Machine <a href="#ref_8">[8]</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's still a lot expense associated with
        building chips. Even with the Instruction Set
        Architecture and the Chip Generator being free
        downloads, the cost of designing and
        manufacturing your own chip isn't
        insubstantial. But with an open specification
        and at least one open-sourced design package,
        it's relatively cheap to evaluate the RISC-V
        architecture and extend the existing software to
        better suit your needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that's part of why people are talking about
        RISC-V. Apart from the technology benefits, the
        licensing model is pretty compelling from a
        business perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        So when people talk about RISC-V, they're
        probably talking about the freely available,
        license-free Instruction Set Architecture or the
        open-sourced tools (like the Rocket Chip
        Generator) that amplify an engineering team's
        efforts. There's also the RISC-V Foundation,
        which is a non-profit spun up to officially own
        the open-sourced design documents and coordinate
        work on new specifications.
      </p>

      <p>
        And from a business perspective, this is all
        interesting because hardware engineering teams
        can inexpensively extend the capabilities of the
        base-level RISC-V cores. Larger companies will
        find their design costs go down and startups
        will find their ideas are finally possible.
      </p>

    <section id="02_The_Base_Spec">

      <h2>What's In the Base Spec?</h2>

      <p>
        The specifications themselves describe an
        abstract computer architecture, complete with a
        description of registers, I/O and (more than
        one) instruction to op-code mappings. If you
        wanted to build a RISC-V processor or write
        software for one, your first stop should be the
        Unprivileged Instruction Set Architecture manual
        <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The RISC-V specification defines a processor
        architecture with 31 general-purpose registers
        and a small collection of Control and Status
        Registers (CSRs). It defines a "base level"
        instruction set for processors with 32, 64 and
        128 bit wide registers (though the 128 bit
        specification is not complete.) The base-level
        instruction set is fairly bare-bones, so a
        series of standard extensions have been
        specified. The idea here is not every chip
        designer will want to use every extension, but
        if they do, they should use the specifications
        defined in the spec. An additional instruction
        set is defined called RV32E (Embedded) that uses
        only 15 general-purpose registers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The base instruction sets are referred to as
        RV32I, RV64I and RV128I and each extension is
        identified with a letter: I for Integer, F for
        Single-Precision and so on. To date, the most
        popular extensions have been:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>I</strong> - Integer (Base)</li>
        <li><strong>M</strong> - Hardware Multiply</li>
        <li><strong>A</strong> - Atomic Operations</li>
        <li><strong>C</strong> - Compressed Op Codes</li>
        <li><strong>F</strong> - Single-Precision Floating Point</li>
        <li><strong>D</strong> - Double-Precision Floating Point</li>
        <li><strong>V</strong> - Vector</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        To describe a core, it's common practice to add
        the extensions you support to the end of the
        base level instruction set. For instance, a 32
        bit core with 31 registers that supports
        hardware multiply and compressed instructions
        would be "RV32IMC." The Integer, Multiply,
        Atomic, Single and Double Precision Floating
        Point extensions were considered so common, they
        have a meta-abbreviation: "G" for
        General-Purpose. So a RV64GC system is the same
        as a RV64IMAFDC system.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Base Integer instruction set itself defines
        a standard (but small) set of instructions: load
        from / store to memory and CSRs, add, branch /
        jump, shift bits, logical operations,
        etc. Readers familiar with other RISC
        architectures will find nothing unusual except
        maybe how small the base level instruction set
        is.
      </p>

      <p>
        When reading the specifications, it's worth
        noting there are at least two naming conventions
        for registers. The first simply names registers
        x0 through x31. Chapter 25 of the current spec
        describes the ABI naming convention. The ABI
        naming convention is useful because it gives
        semantic meaning to registers 0 through 15 which
        are important for compressed instructions and
        the RV32E (Embedded) ISA.
      </p>

      <p>
        RISC-V instructions are multiples of 16-bits,
        but both the 32 and 64 bit base instruction sets
        define instructions in terms of 32-bits. The "C"
        (Compressed) extension maps "commonly used"
        32-bit instructions to 16-bit aliases. The
        specification explains this was done to make
        simpler 32-bit-only implementations possible,
        but providing a standard way to increase code
        density through 16-bit compressed instructions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The RISC-V foundation sponsors projects to add
        support to popular open source projects
        including GCC, LLVM, QEMU and Linux. At the time
        this document was written, RISC-V support had
        been "up-streamed" to each of these projects.

      <h2>The Privileged Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        While RISC-V isn't attempting to be all things
        to all users, it is trying to be many things to
        many users. The two main types of systems RISC-V
        supports are small, embedded, single-application
        devices and large, beefy, high-performance
        processors that run "real" operating systems like
        Linux or BSD.
      </p>

      <p>
        Modern, secure operating systems essentially
        require virtual memory support and the separation
        between User and Supervisor modes. User mode
        runs application code in a sandbox that doesn't
        give the app unfettered access to the hardware or
        other applications. Supervisor mode, which runs
        the operating system kernel and probably device
        drivers, <em>does</em> have such access.
        have that access. User mode runs applications.
        Supervisor mode runs operating systems. If you've
        never heard of this before, the Wikipedia has a
        decent page about protection rings and privilege
        modes <a href="#ref_9">[9]</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Volume II of the RISC-V Instruction Set Manual
        <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a> describes different
        operating modes and the Control and Status
        Registers (CSRs) that support features like
        virtual memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        The spec defines three modes: Machine, Supervisor
        and User. We mentioned Supervisor and User above.
        Machine mode is for embedded devices with no
        mode-based security, or Hypervisors. Hypervisors
        are like "super-operating-systems" that let
        multiple instances of operating systems on one
        physical CPU. Hypervisors are extremely important
        to the modern tech ecosystem. Most cloud based
        applications run in a hypervisor-enabled virtual
        machine in someone's data center, somewhere.
        If you're unfamiliar with hypervisors, the
        Wikipedia has a decent article about the
        concept <a href="#ref_10">[10]</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        With three defined modes, you may think there
        are seven supported combinations of modes. But
        modes build on each other. You'll never see a
        RISC-V CPU without the Machine mode and if a
        RISC-V CPU supports Supervisor mode, it will
        also support User mode.  The spec defines three
        combinations of modes and gives hints as to what
        they would be used for:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>M</strong> - Used for simple embedded
          systems.</li>
        <li><strong>M, U</strong> - Used for secure
          embedded systems.</li>
        <li><strong>M, S, U</strong> - For systems
          running modern Unix-like operating systems</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section id="04_Everything_Else">
      <h2>Everything Else</h2>

      <p>
        But there's way more to RISC-V than a couple of
        spec documents. Even the list of extensions
        mentioned above isn't complete. There's an
        extension for Vector operations which should
        accelerate complex math operations used in
        cryptography and machine learning significantly
        <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A pair of specifications: the debug spec
        <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a> and the trace spec
        <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a> define standard
        interfaces debug tools can use to understand
        what's happening in the CPU.
