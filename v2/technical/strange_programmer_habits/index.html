        If you've been programming for a while, you've
        probably seen your fair share of weird
        code. Much of that weird code is just plain bad;
        it isn't obvious, it's undocumented and it makes
        the person maintaining it thing "what the hell
        were they thinking?" Eventually you learn
        software rarely emerges fully formed from some
        heroic programmer's forehead. It's a collection
        of hacks layered on top of each other (most
        applied at 3AM after your system goes down.)

        However… there are a number of constructions
        I've come across that appeared strange at first,
        but then later turned out to embody non-obvious
        wisdom.

        This is an attempt to catalog a few of these
        patterns. You don't have to use them. You don't
        have to agree with them. But it might be worth
        learning about them so you'll know more about
        what the original author was thinking.
