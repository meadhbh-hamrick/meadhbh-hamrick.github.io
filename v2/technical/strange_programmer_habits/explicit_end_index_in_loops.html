        This is another entry in the <a href="index.html">Strange
        Programmer Habits</a>" series. In each article we
        investigate a strange-looking construction which
        has a legitimate, but non-obvious purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this article, we look at why we might want to
        set up the exit condition of a for loop when
        it's initialized. Let's start by looking at a
        "normal" loop in JavaScript:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   var str = "I am a test string";

   for( var i = 0; i &lt; str.length; i++ ) {
     var char = str.substr( i, 1 );
     console.log( `Character ${i} is ${char}` );
   }</pre>

      <p>
        Nothing could be clearer: loop through each
        character in the string, printing out a message
        on the console for each character. But every now
        and again, you'll see something like this
        instead:

      <pre class="code">

   for( var i = 0, il = str.length; i &lt; il; i++ ) {
     var char = str.substr( i, 1 );
     console.log( `Character ${i} is ${char}` );
   }</pre>

      <p>
        Why did they do this? Should you do it to?
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer to the second question is "probably
        not" if you're a JavaScript programmer and "it
        depends" if you're a C programmer.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the early days of JavaScript, implementations
        were not horribly efficient. (Looking at you,
        Rhino.) Old implementations weren't smart enough
        to know strings like the one in the example
        above weren't changing each time through the
        loop. So it punted and called strlen() or Java's
        String.length() method each time through the
        loop.
      </p>

      <p>
        By calculating the length once, assigning it to
        a variable and <em>then</em> looping through the
        loop, you could recover a small amount of
        execution time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most programmers probably didn't need to worry
        about this; they weren't coding nested loops that
        looped over large arrays. But the few programmers
        I met who did do this insisted they got a speed
        boost from it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your mileage may vary, though. Most modern
        JavaScript implementations are fast and can make
        decent guesses about whether or not an array or
        string is changing as you iterate across its
        members.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        C programmers don't have it so easy, however.
        While JavaScript is single threaded except in
        well defined cases, C programs could be
        single-threaded or a multi-threaded, and the
        compiler might not know ahead of time. If you
        coded a loop that depends on the length of a
        string or an array being consistent across
        iterations, it's up to you to figure out if the
        memory you're accessing is getting changed by
        another thread.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the compiler can't guarantee a string's
        length won't change without warning, it won't
        aggressively memoize the results of function
        calls. If you execute this code in C, it will
        call strlen() each time through the loop.
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include &lt;string.h&gt;

   int main() {
     char * teststr = "I am a test string.";

     for( int i = 0; i &lt; strlen( teststr ); i++ ) {
       printf( "Char %d is %c\n", i, teststr[i] );
     }

     return( 0 );
   }</pre>

      <p>
        So, if you know you're not in a multi-threaded
        environment, you might want to modify the loop
        to look something more like this. It'll only
        call strlen() once.
      </p>
        
      <pre class="code">

   for( int i = 0, il = strlen( teststr ); i &lt; il; i++ ) {
</pre>
