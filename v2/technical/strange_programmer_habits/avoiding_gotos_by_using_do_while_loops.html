        This is another in a series of
        "<a href="index.html">Strange Programmer Habits</a>"
        articles. In each article we highlight a
        strange-looking construction that looks wrong at
        first glance, but has a legitimate purpose. You
        don't have to use this construct to be a decent
        programmer. You don't even have to agree with
        it's justification. But after reading this
        article, you'll hopefully understand what was
        going through the mind of the programmer that
        used the construction it describes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the early days of computer software,
        programmers were using languages like assembly,
        FORTRAN, COBOL and LISP to produce reasonably
        small programs to compute trajectories, maintain
        inventory databases or accounting systems and
        whatnot. Computing systems weren't big enough to
        allow programmers to make the massive software
        systems like modern operating systems, web
        browsers or computer games.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is probably why it took a couple decades
        for people to understand how bad "spaghetti
        code" was; it's easy to dismiss spaghetti being
        a problem when your complete software system is
        one or two pages long. But when a printout of
        your system requires you to chop down a medium
        sized forest, concepts like "structured
        programming" and "design patterns" really start
        to become important.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the popular issues around the
        programmers' water-cooler in the 1980's was
        whether or not people who use GOTO's should have
        their fingers chopped off. Edsger Djikstra
        penned the canonical software engineering
        jeremiad about this subject entitled “GO-TO
        Statement Considered Harmful” [PDF]. You can
        probably guess his opinion from the paper's
        title.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the 80's and 90's, software engineers were
        taught that GOTO's led to un-maintainable
        software, headaches and all manner of social
        ills ranging from global warming to bad
        movies. "Use a GOTO," they would say, "and it's
        like asking the local DJ to play Disco Duck on
        the radio." Structured programming, good
        software engineering technique and eschewing
        GOTO's would lead to a new era of increasingly
        good Cure albums, Alien sequels that didn't suck
        and fewer midnight sessions at the office
        debugging the crap code you wrote last year.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, like the "one true ring," the expressive
        power of the GOTO is difficult to resist. Many
        software wizards, on their way to a life of
        perdition (i.e. - writing video games) countered
        that the GOTO could be used on occasion, if done
        correctly. Consider the following routine; it
        tries to open a file and read a few bytes. If
        there are errors along the way, it uses a goto
        to branch to clean-up routine before exiting:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   int doSomething( char *filename ) {
     int err = 0;
     FILE *file = (FILE *) NULL;
     char buffer[ 80 ];
     size_t bytesRead = 0;

     if( NULL == filename ) {
       err = -1; goto exuent_omnis;
     }

     if( (FILE *)NULL == ( file = fopen( filename, “r” ) ) ) {
       err = errno; goto exuent_omnis;
     }

     bytesRead = fread( buffer, 80, 1, file );

     if( ferror( file ) ) {
       err = -2; goto exuent_omnis;
     }

     /* more code here that actually does something */

   exuent_omnis:

     if( (FILE *) NULL != file ) {
       fclose( file );
     }

     return( err );
   }</pre>

      <p>
        "What could be wrong with this?" the pro-GOTO
        lobby would ask. IMHO, this example is pretty
        readable, and the GOTO does actually increase
        readability. Especially if you consider that
        nested if's are frequently offered as the
        alternative:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   int doSomething( char *filename ) { 
     int err = 0;
     FILE *file = (FILE *) NULL;
     char buffer[ 80 ];
     size_t bytesRead = 0;

     if( NULL != filename ) {
       if( (FILE *)NULL != ( file = fopen( filename, “r” ) ) ) {
         bytesRead = fread( buffer, 80, 1, file );
         if( ! ferror( file ) ) {
           /* more code here */
         } else {
           err = -2;
         }
         fclose( file ):
       } else {
         err = errno;
       }
     } else {
       err = -1;
     }
     return( err );
   }</pre>

      <p>
        People who propose extensive use of nested if's
        should have their thumbs broken. This example
        isn't that bad, but when nested ifs start
        spanning pages, they can get a bit difficult to
        read. The alternative to using GOTOs in this
        example would be to use a do...while() loop
        whose repeat condition has been explicitly set
        to zero (or false for C++ users.):
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   int doSomething( char *filename ) {
     int err = 0;
     char buffer[ 80 ];
     size_t bytesRead = 0;

     do {
       if( NULL == filename ) {
         err = -1; break;
       }

       if( (FILE *)NULL == ( file = fopen( filename, “r” ) ) ) {
         err = errno; break;
       }

       bytesRead = fread( buffer, 80, 1, file );

       if( ferror( file ) ) {
         err = -2; break;
       }

       /* more code here */

     } while( 0 );

     if( (FILE *) NULL != file ) {
       fclose( file );
     }

     return( err );
   }</pre>

      <p>
        Developers who like this kind of code will tell
        you it captures the succinct directness of a
        GOTO without actually having a GOTO. Because we
        break out of the loop, there's only one place
        control can go: to the statement after the
        while( 0 ); And we avoid nested if's. I've
        encountered at least one developer who believes
        this technique is harmful; it uses the
        do...while language feature for something it was
        not intended for, and as such, could be
        confusing to younger programmers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you make Djikstra cry by using a GOTO,
        produce deep levels of indents or use a
        do...while(0) that confuse inexpert programmers
        is entirely up to you. But hopefully this
        article will have made you aware of the
        different techniques you'll encounter in the
        wild.
