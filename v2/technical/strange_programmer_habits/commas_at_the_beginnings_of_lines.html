    <title>Commas at the Beginnings of Lines</title>

    <section>
      
      <p>
        This is another in a series of
        "<a href="index.html">Strange Programmer Habits</a>"
        articles. In each article we highlight a
        strange-looking construction that looks wrong at
        first glance, but has a legitimate purpose. You
        don't have to use this construct to be a decent
        programmer. You don't even have to agree with
        it's justification. But after reading this
        article, you'll hopefully understand what was
        going through the mind of the programmer that
        used the construction it describes.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, consider this C program:
      </p>
          
      <pre class="code">

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   #define _VERB_LENGTH 5

   char *verbs[] = {
     "quit"
   , "score"
   , "inventory"
   , "go"
   , "get"
   };

   int main() {
     int i;

     for( i = 0; i &lt; _VERB_LENGTH; i++ ) {
       printf( "verb %02d: %s\n", i, verbs[ i ] );
     }
   }</pre>

      <p>
        or it's javascript equivalent:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   var verbs = [
       "quit"
     , "score"
     , "inventory"
     , "go"
     , "get"
   ];

   for( var i = 0, il = verbs.length; i &lt; il; i++ ) {
     console.log( "verb " + i + ": " + verbs[ i ] )
   }</pre>

      <p>
        Both these programs declare an array of strings
        and then print them out. But contrary to popular
        convention, the commas separating individual
        elements of the verbs array come not at the end
        of the line, but at the beginning.
      </p>

      <p>
        The compiler (or interpreter) couldn't care less
        about this stylistic convention, of course. All
        it cares about is if there are commas between
        array elements. The comma-first style is there
        to make it easier for you to add, delete or move
        single lines in the array. By putting the comma
        at the beginning of the line, you move the
        elements in the array around without having to
        manually add (or remove) a trailing comma at the
        end of the array.
      </p>

      <p>
        This strange habit doesn't effect the output
        your compiler produces and it's main benefit is
        to save a couple milliseconds when cutting and
        pasting entries in an array. But a small number
        of programmers (myself included) have gotten
        used to seeing arrays that look like this, so
        don't be surprised if you see this style from
        time to time.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, you might be thinking, "this is
        crazy, it's just as likely you'll want to move
        an item from the beginning of an array where you
        don't have a leading comma as it is you'll want
        to move an item at the end of an array where
        there's no trailing comma."
      </p>

      <p>
        And you're right.
      </p>

      <p>
        This strange habit is only beneficial if you
        seldom modify the beginning of an array. In this
        case I'm not trying to convince you this is a
        thing you should do as try to explain what
        someone was thinking when they did it. A counter
        example is this code:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   char *verbs[] = {
     "quit" ,
     "score" ,
     "inventory",
     "go",
     "get",
     NULL
   };

   int main() {
     int i;

     for( i = 0; verbs[i] != NULL; i++ ) {
       printf( "verb %02d: %s\n", i, verbs[ i ] );
     }
   }</pre>

      <p>
        This code is functionally equivalent to the C program above, but removing the NULL pointer from the list of verbs will break this code. Thus, you're sort of guaranteed to never want to remove the last item. Again, not trying to convince you to do this. Just pointing out this is something people sometimes do.
      </p>
