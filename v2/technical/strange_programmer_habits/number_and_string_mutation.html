        This is another in a series of
        "<a href="index.html">Strange Programmer
        Habits</a>" articles. In each article we
        highlight a strange-looking construction that
        looks wrong at first glance, but has a
        legitimate purpose. You don't have to use this
        construct to be a decent programmer. You don't
        even have to agree with it's justification. But
        after reading this article, you'll hopefully
        understand what was going through the mind of
        the programmer that used the construction it
        describes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of my favorite programming languages allow
        you to be "fast and loose" with data
        types. JavaScript and PHP, for instance, will
        convert variables between number and string
        types as needed. Some consider this behavior to
        be "sub-optimal," while others don't. But
        understanding how your programming language
        converts literals or variables between types is
        important, no matter what language you're using.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider the following C program:
      </p>

      <pre>

  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  int main( int argc, char *argv[] ) {
    char *start = "1234";
    int a = 2;
    printf( "%s\n", (start + a ) );
  }</pre>

      <p>
        When you compile and run this program, it prints
        out the string "34" and then exits. Now look at
        this JavaScript function:
      </p>

      <pre>

  function foo() {
    var start = "1234";
    var a = 2;
    console.log( start + a );
  }</pre>

      <p>
        It should print out the string "12342".
        Understanding why C does one thing and
        JavaScript does another is important. C
        aficionados can probably quickly point out that
        the printf() function was taking a pointer to an
        array of characters as it's input. Adding the
        integer 2 to the pointer caused it to point 2
        bytes ahead. When interpreted as a string,
        "(start + a)" is simply a two byte string with
        the value "34".
      </p>

      <p>
        JavaScript, on the other hand, converts the
        number 2 into the string '2' and appends it to
        the string.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doing the same thing in PHP yields even
        different results. Executing the following PHP
        fragment will cause the system to print the
        string "1236":
      </p>

      <pre>

  $start = "1234";
  $a = 2;
  echo ( $start + $a );</pre>

      <p>
        PHP peeks inside the variable $start, sees that
        it looks like a number and then converts it to
        an integer and performs the addition.
      </p>

      <p>
        JavaScript provides functions to convert numbers
        to strings and vice versa. The "String( val )"
        function attempts to convert the argument 'val'
        to a string while the "Number( val )" function
        attempts to convert 'val' to a number. People
        went to the trouble of specifying these
        functions and documenting them, so you might as
        well use them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some people, their minds perhaps addled by
        exposure to early versions of PHP have been seen
        to do things like this in javascript:
      </p>

      <pre>

  var a = 12;
  console.log( "" + a );</pre>

      <p>or</p>

      <pre>

  var b = '34';
  console.log( 1 * b );  // Common for people coming to JavaScript from PHP
  console.log( b|0 );    // More commonly used in the V8 / WebAssembly community</pre>

      <p>
        Adding an empty string to a number in JavaScript
        will (should) cause the interpreter to convert
        the value of a into a string. Multiplying the
        string b by one should do the opposite (convert
        the string into a number.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Some people believe this type of conversion is
        faster, others think it's just plain ugly. It is
        certainly the case that "standard" functions
        exist to do the same thing, and might convey the
        programmer's intent more clearly. To complicate
        matters further, the WebAssembly community uses
        a series of in-line conversions instead of
        explicit calls to Number() or String(). In an
        ideal world, the JavaScript JITter would
        recognize both (b|0) and Number(b) as equivalent
        statements and generate the same code. We don't
        live in an ideal world, however.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's entirely up to you how you use to coerce a
        value to a particular type. But if you inherit
        code with superfluous additions, or's and
        multiplications, this might be what's going on.
      </p>
