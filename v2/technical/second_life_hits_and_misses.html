        <em>[This article originally appeared on my blog
          in June 2010. -Ed.]</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Word on the street is Linden Lab
        <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>, makers of the
        Second Life™<a href="#ref_2">[2]</a> virtual
        world, is in the process of laying off staff and
        shuttering remote offices. The few stories have
        surfaced over the last couple days are fueled by
        rumor and inductive reasoning. ( See Tateru
        Nino's story "Linden Lab Laying Off Staff,
        Closing Singapore Office"
        <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a> at massively.com for an
        example. ) Tateru's narrative is well told, but
        as of yet, Linden hasn't commented publicly
        regarding staff reductions. Reports of
        instability in the Linden Dollar exchange, the
        departure of key employees
        <a href="#asterisk">[*]</a> and a failure to
        meet resident growth expectations have been
        feeding rumors of Second Life's demise.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I'm not ready write off Second Life just
        quite yet. A lot of cool stuff came out of
        Linden Lab and even if the rumors of lay-offs
        are true, there will remain a nucleus of highly
        competent people delivering innovative new
        services.
      </p>

      <p>
        So while we're waiting to hear an official word
        from Linden about staff changes, let's take a
        quick look at some of the Linden Lab hits and
        misses.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>*HIT* User Generated Content (aka UGC)</h2>

      <p>
        Linden didn't invent the concept of "user
        generated content," but they were one of the
        first groups to really run with it. While
        universes like There.Com and ActiveWorlds also
        allowed UGC, Second Life allowed users to upload
        textures and build content in-world without
        prior editorial constraint.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're in a world of "remix culture" where
        content innovation is fueled by the never ending
        stream of ubiquitous, culturally relevant
        media. In other words, we create meaning by
        reworking existing context in new and better
        contexts. Whether it's an artist that places a
        virtual Gandhi avatar in a virtual jail cell
        <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a> or simply a group of
        people gathering in world to discuss ideas
        <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>, society as a whole
        benefits from the understanding and insight that
        comes from placing old media in a new context.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the future, Second Life will be remembered as
        the first popular virtual world that understood
        this interplay between media and context and
        made it easy for participants to communicate
        "insight" by means of radical juxtaposition of
        common, socially relevant symbols.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>*MISS* User Generated Content (aka UGC)</h2>

      <p>
        But it's not all goodness and light out there on
        the grid. There are serious issues with content
        theft and misappropriation of digital
        assets. Linden's process for dealing with IP
        theft follows guidelines established after
        passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
        (DMCA.) While the Linden process appears in
        accord with US law, it does little (if anything)
        to prevent IP theft. Instead it provides a
        mechanism to repair damage already done; it
        requires IP owners to police the entire virtual
        world looking for infringers.
      </p>

      <p>
        UGC is Second Life's "raison d'être." Without
        it, it would be an exceedingly bland
        experience. Some would argue that this virtual
        world is based on a system that ultimately
        discounts real world IPR by making infringement
        laughably easy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>*MISS* Pornography</h2>

      <p>
        The most obvious issue with the lack of prior
        editorial control on user generated content is
        the presence of pornography and obscene adult
        materials on Second Life's main grid. Expression
        of every carnal delight may be found in second
        life, ranging from "mildly unusual" to "outright
        obscene." Second Life is very clearly an "adults
        only" space; do not leave your children here
        unattended.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>*HIT* Pornography</h2>

      <p>
        One person's obscenity is another's harmless
        fantasy. People are sexual creatures and
        stigmatizing physically pleasurable activities
        as being "dirty" or "obscene" does little to
        advance society and culture. Providing a space
        where individuals may come to terms with
        potentially embarrassing fantasies in an
        anonymous manner might actually have mental
        health benefits. Members of the transgender and
        fetish communities may experience very real
        emotional distress that prevents them from
        exploring taboo subjects in real life. The
        virtual world provides a safe, anonymous space
        to develop an understanding of the sexual
        self. This is in no way a bad thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The virtual world can also be a place where the
        disabled are able to explore their sexual
        persona. In the west, we sometimes force
        disabled people into a very non-sexual corner.;
        sex and disability can be a taboo subject in
        mainstream culture. For many disabled people,
        creating a sexually explicitly avatar in a
        virtual world can be liberating; especially as
        they have direct control over the degree to
        which their "real life" disability is expressed
        in the virtual world.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>*HIT* Group Building</h2>

      <p>
        Most virtual experiences use assets created by a
        single person on a single desktop machine. Sure,
        digital assets can be created by groups of
        talented artists, and I'm guessing that most
        are. At the end of the day, there's only one
        person with one mouse altering one copy of the
        digital asset. Once the change is complete, the
        asset is saved in a file and distributed to
        other participants in the creative process.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second Life's model is different. Building is an
        inherently social experience. Assets are created
        in the same virtual world participants
        inhabit. In fact, it's quite easy to find groups
        of people collaboratively building virtual
        things in one of the many "sandboxes" spread
        throughout SL's main grid.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Second Life build system is the 3D
        equivalent of tools like Google Docs or
        Etherpad, when one person rotates a piece of an
        object being built, everyone with an avatar in
        the vicinity immediately sees the
        result. Everyone can immediately critique (or
        approve) the change.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>*HIT* Digital Economy</h2>

      <p>
        To be sure, selling things in Second Life can be
        a pain. But over the last several years it's
        gotten increasingly less painful. In many online
        virtual worlds and MMORPGs, you can only buy
        content from the company running the
        experience. Turning the virtual world into a
        venue for individual-to-individual transactions
        is a true "hit."
      </p>

      <p>
        Transactions totaling millions of US Dollars are
        executed annually. Real people are making real
        money selling bits; and that's a beautiful
        thing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>*MISS* Land and Object Backups</h2>

      <p>
        In an ideal (virtual) world, the content you
        create would stand as an eternal testament to
        your creative prowess. Sadly, we live in a real
        world where software bugs, database failures and
        system crashes conspire to delete the fruits of
        your online labor. In Second Life, you build on
        the live system. While there are backups
        occasionally, it is all to easy for your content
        to mysteriously disappear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Products like Second Inventory
        <a href="#ref_6">[6]</a> allow individual
        content creators to explicitly save their
        creations. Linden Lab appears to have an "uneasy
        truce" with services like Second Inventory. You
        may find some Lindens privately acknowledge the
        utility of backing up content, but no one will
        go on the record publicly praising or damning
        the service. Second Inventory (and similar
        utilities in third party viewers) can too easily
        be corrupted into a tool that could allow
        unauthorized content copying. Supporting such a
        tool would not be a move welcomed by Second
        Life's content creation community.
      </p>

      <p>
        So a content backup tool, which would be of
        great utility to content creators, could also be
        perverted into a weapon that could destroy the
        livelihood of that same community. Maybe someday
        there will be a tool that gives people the
        ability to backup and restore content they own,
        and only content they own. But until that
        facility is perfected this feature is probably
        going to remain too dangerous for general
        deployment.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>*HIT* Spatial Voice Chat</h2>

      <p>
        A fair amount of attention has been paid to
        virtual worlds as venues for education and
        business events. Whether you're talking about
        using the virtual world to teach classes or meet
        with your business partners, the experience is
        still pretty compelling.
      </p>

      <p>
        A lot of people ask, however, "how is Second
        Life different than a chat room or a WebEX
        presentation?" And you'll get a lot of different
        answers to this question. But I recently had the
        opportunity to watch new users learn a bit about
        the virtual world. These were people who were
        technically savvy, but not "Virtual Worlds
        People." I was a little surprised to discover
        that after they learned the interface, they
        found the experience "reasonably compelling."
        When asked why, their response was... "it was
        easy to figure out who was talking."
      </p>

      <p>
        So... virtual meeting planners take note: real
        people like it when it's obvious who's avatar is
        speaking.

      <h2>*MISS* Walled Garden</h2>

      <p>
        Second Life has aspects of other great online
        systems: it has the social networking of
        Facebook and Twitter; it has the ability to host
        content like Flickr; and it has the ability to
        host group conversations like IRC or Google
        Chat. But Second Life is not Facebook or Twitter
        or Flickr or Google Chat. It doesn't do any of
        these things nearly as well as these sites.
      </p>

      <p>
        And maybe that's okay. Second Life is about
        creating immersive 3D experiences. It is not
        about image hosting or IRC chat sessions. The 3D
        experience creates an engaging social context
        that you just can't get from the 2D web. It's
        okay for Second Life to not be as good as
        Twitter or Facebook on the whole social
        networking thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        But what isn't okay is that I can't link my
        Second Life identity with my Twitter identity or
        my LinkedIn identity. My FaceBook friends are
        not automatically my Second Life friends, and
        that's a problem. The "friction" involved in
        engaging my external accounts in the virtual
        world means it will never have the size and
        scope Linden's executives keep talking about.
      </p>

      <p>
        Until Linden breaks down the garden walls and
        allows virtual land, assets and identities to be
        hosted by external organizations, Second Life
        will remain a pleasantly curious island in the
        sea of internet commerce and communication.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        So there we have it, my short list of Second
        Life's "greatest hits and misses." What are
        yours?
      </p>

      <p>
        * In the interest of full-disclosure, I should
          remind readers that I worked for Linden
          recently, though my role probably didn't
          qualify me as a "key" employee.
