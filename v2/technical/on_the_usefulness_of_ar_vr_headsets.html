    <title>On The Usefulness of VR/AR Headsets</title>

    <section>
      
      <p>
        So a couple days ago I spent a few moments
        tweeting about how much "hope for the future"
        was embedded inside home computers of the
        1980s. I was commenting not so much on the
        technology itself, but the culture that
        surrounded it. We were a bunch of social misfits
        hoping to make the world a better place. We were
        going to bring people together, democratize
        access to information and extend people's
        ability to solve problems through the use of
        algorithms.
      </p>

      <p>
        And we more or less did that. But it didn't lead
        to a utopia. We're in the middle of ANOTHER
        software crisis (Joe Armstrong has a decent talk
        about this on YouTube <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>)
        We have cyber-bullying. We have the intarwebs
        destroying newspapers, main street shops and the
        recording industry. (granted, the recording
        industry needed destroying.)
      </p>

      <p>
        And I guess what I want to do is warn people off
        of looking at the renaissance of VR & AR
        headsets as being some exclusively positive
        event that will make everyone beautiful,
        productive and skilled.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I was a young octopus, my friend John
        Branch and I spent some time playing with the
        Private Eye. In the '90s i got to meet steve
        mann and play with the EyeTap prototypes. Those
        devices were like the "homebrew" personal
        computers of the 1970s. The Oculus Rift and the
        Cast AR headsets are probably more like the
        Commodore 64 and Atari 800.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're just now starting to see what the
        applications are beyond games. And sure, VR
        could spend its entire life as a game technology
        and still be very interesting. But I think all
        of us want to see more from virtual and
        augmented reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Magic Leap has yet to release it's
        headset. Early reports say it's going to blow
        away the HoloLens and make us forget GoogleGlass
        ever existed. Maybe it will be the "IBM PC" of
        the AR/VR era.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I keep thinking about how hopeful we were in
        the '70s and '80s about how computers would
        change our lives for the better. Sure, for the
        most part it's a big win, but it doesn't come
        without some drawbacks that were hard to imagine
        back then.
      </p>

      <p>
        Virtual and Augmented reality is getting cheaper
        as time marches on. But let's not forget it's an
        immersive technology; even Google Glass(es) are
        not items which enable "casual" computing. It's
        going to be great for games, sure. But I'm a
        little bullish on some of the claims i'm
        hearing. They remind me of the old days when
        people said "oh! you can use your computer to
        balance your checkbook." -- Yes, you could use
        your computer to balance your checkbook, but
        until spreadsheets were ubiquitous, it was
        pretty onerous to load a checkbook program, load
        existing data from a cassette tape or floppy,
        then manually enter new transactions. It was
        simpler just to balance your checkbook by
        hand. Bank websites are the distant descendants
        of those checkbook programs, and they are very
        useful (though sometimes i worry about their
        security.)
      </p>

      <p>
        In the same way I think we're at the beginning
        of understanding how augmented reality can
        improve day to day living. You don't have to be
        a cheerleader for AR; there are enough people
        out there who appreciate what it can do. If your
        business model assumes EVERYONE is going to buy
        a AR or VR headset for non-gaming purposes, you
        may want to rethink things a bit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure, uptake of technology is now faster than in
        the old days, but it's still not instantaneous.
      </p>

      <p>
        To review... VR is probably going to be a hit
        with gaming. VR for "serious" apps is going to
        be harder. Augmented Reality for gaming is going
        to be interesting, but i think we're still
        waiting to see the initial experiences that will
        drive adoption in the mass market. AR for
        "serious" apps is going to be hard, but probably
        not as hard as VR. There's a future in both
        technologies, but please stop over-promising on
        what AR and/or VR can and will deliver.
