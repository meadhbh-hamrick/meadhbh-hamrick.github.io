    <title>Talking With Michael About Software</title>

    <section>
      
      <p>
        "No Michael," I said emphatically, "the cost
        isn't the big thing."
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I was kicking back in Michael's office finishing
        off a gin and tonic and avoiding smoking the
        clove cigarettes scattered about the
        room. Michael was one of the company's two
        directors and had the largest office in the
        building. Before taking over as director of our
        company, he was a professional shepherd in
        northern England. Artifacts of his ovisiary past
        littered the room: wool seat covers, wool
        macrame art, small woolen tapestries. It was the
        type of room a sensitive male from 1978 would be
        proud of, but this was 1990.
      </p>

      <p>
        "The cost is the only thing," Michael shot back,
        eyes perched atop a nose slanted just far back
        to make it clear i was being looked down upon,
        "you lived through the home computer wars; you
        saw what Commodore did to Texas Instruments."
      </p>

      <p>
        Whenever Michael wanted to make a point about
        how small upstarts can take on large incumbents,
        he always went back to Commodore. This time he
        was being doubly-unkind. He knew my uncle was a
        vice president at TI and that I had been a "true
        believer" in the 9900 architecture a decade
        earlier.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Yes. Cost is important," I started, "if Apple
        had released the Mac at a price even close to
        discount PCs, it would completely decimate IBM's
        market."
      </p>

      <p>
        Michael looked confused; he must not have
        thought I would capitulate so quickly. I jumped
        in quickly before he could respond, "But costs
        always go down. It's the one truth of our
        industry."
      </p>

      <p>
        He was about to talk, but I cut him off again,
        "What is expensive today is average in eighteen
        months and cheap in three years. Our development
        cycle is about nine-months, so that gives us
        four releases to build a core product people
        want to buy."
      </p>

      <p>
        "But our burn rate is much too high," Michael
        shot back. I couldn't argue with that. I had
        done a back of the envelope calculation and
        realized there was no way we could continue with
        our current staffing levels.
      </p>

      <p>
        "We're done with the Casio and Sharp ports next
        month," I said, "we can move those resources to
        OS development then; there's more than enough
        work to keep them busy."
      </p>

      <p>
        Michael looked unconvinced. He leaned back in
        his chair, his clasped hands in front of his
        mouth, his face dour.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Tech support moves to DAC after we deliver the
        ports and we can let go of our hardware
        business," I continued.
      </p>

      <p>
        "We can't get rid of the hardware. It's Sam's
        baby. He'll never let it happen," Michael
        responded.
      </p>

      <p>
        "How could he block it?" I asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Sam's a senior shareholder in the venture,"
        Michael answered; I knew our other director,
        Sam, had sunk some of his own money into the
        venture, but this was the first time I realized
        how much.
      </p>

      <p>
        Michael took this moment to take back the
        conversation I had dominated. "We have to make
        something work with commodity PC hardware," he
        said, "Putera's made it clear we can't build our
        own PCs."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Hunh?" i responded, confused.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Putera's happy to make modems and act as an
        integrator of small PCs, but the OS can't depend
        on custom hardware," Michael said.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Ah," I responded, finally understanding, "Daddy
        Warbucks will pay for a truck-stop but not the
        Taj Mahal."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Yup," Michael replied with his best American
        accent.
      </p>

      <p>
        "So there's no chance we'll be making a
        NeXT-killer," I said, dejectedly.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Nope."
      </p>

      <p>
        "What if we added some of the NeXT software
        development bits to our OS?" I asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        "What bits?" Michael asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        "We could rip off Interface Builder," I replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Why bother?" Michael responded, "it's just
        ResEdit on steroids."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Have you looked at it?" I asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Sure," Michael answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        "No. Have you built an app with it?" I asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Should I?" Michael shot back.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Yup."
      </p>

      <p>
        Michael sighed and continued, "I worry it won't
        matter. Microsoft has beat everyone to the
        punch. Have you seen Windows 3?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "It still has a lot of bugs," I replied, "and is
        still pretty confusing. People will never buy
        it."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Compaq is supposedly going to bundle it with
        their new PCs," Michael said.
      </p>

      <p>
        "So what?" I asked, "So a lot of people see how
        crappy it is."
      </p>

      <p>
        "You remember when the PC first launched?"
        Michael asked, "you could get PC-DOS, CP/M-86 or
        the UCSD p-system. PC-DOS was effectively free
        while the other two cost money and had an
        existing user base."
      </p>

      <p>
        "I see where you're going," I replied, "CP/M and
        p-system are effectively dead and Microsoft made
        millions off PC-DOS."
      </p>

      <p>
        "People like free things," Michael said.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Yeah. Damn Them," I replied, "Damn Them."
      </p>
