    <title>Why Do We Log?</title>

      <p>
        It seems like it should have an obvious answer.
        Why do we log things in online applications?
        <i>To know what happened</i>, obviously.
        But I assert our intent falls in at least three different categories:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>To verify the program is behaving correctly (debugging)</li>
        <li>To verify something happened at the application layer (something happened)</li>
        <li>To verify the performance of the program falls within acceptable limits (telemetry)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        In each of these cases, there is benefit to having a system monitoring logs.
        But the specific type of system may be different for each category.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the debugging case, maybe it's an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) reading the logs, attempting to reconstruct what happened in the program.
        Much has been written already about making telemetry <i>observable</i> <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a> <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a>.
        Telemetry data is typically fed into a system which can (at least) warn human operators something is going wrong and (hopefully) take some basic actions to avert disaster.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for the "something happened" category, these are log messages which assert a particular (often irreversable) action has occurred on behalf of the customer / client.
        I often call these types of logging messages <i>entropic</i> because of their irreversable nature.
        You've either processed a request or you haven't; and once a request is processed, it's hard to unprocess; it's a one-way operation.
        Your systems shouldn't depend on log messages to determine whether a request is complete; applications should maintain that state directly.
        But if a customer calls up and asks about a specific event from several weeks ago, you may have to query your logs to verify your application did (or didn't) do what it was supposed to.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's some overlap between telemetry and entropic log message.
        I like to think of <i>"telemetry"</i> being focused on the performance of the systems which implement the application while <i>"SLA / Entropic"</i> log messages are focused on the application domain.
        Entropic messages might be useful to produce Service Level Agreement (SLA) or Operational Level Agreement (OLA) metrics.
        But if you look at the list of Common Metrics in the Wikipedia's "Service Level Agreement" article <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a>, you'll see metrics that could break either way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another way to think about it is to ask if a particular log message tells you about the performance of an underlying resource (telemetry) or whether the recorded event moves a customer's business process into or towards a subsequent state.
        If the "business side" of the organization cares about it, it's <i>probably</i> an Entropic / SLA metric.
        If the "tech side" of the organization cares about it, it's <i>probably</i> telemetry.

      <h2>Step 1 : Make it Easy for Programs to Read Your Logs</h2>

      <p>
        Larry Wall famously quipped <i>"computer languages differ not so much in what they make possible, but in what they make easy."</i> <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a>
        We can borrow that quote to produce this bit of wisdom: <b><i>"logging systems differ not so much in what they log, but in how easy it is to read the logs."</i></b>
        If you don't make a log message that can be consumed, why are you emitting that message?
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider this log excerpt:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
2021-07-06T09:25:17.813Z DEBUG Entering foo() to process request d44dcf8c-df41-11eb-9186-6723ffa51662
2021-07-06T09:25:18.501Z DEBUG Retrieved state is 14.
2021-07-06T09:25:18.556Z DEBUG Illegal state detected</pre>

      <p>
        This tells you (the human) everything you need to know.
        But it's somewhat hard to parse.
        If you wanted to make a tool that searched through the logs to find requests with illegal states, you would have to know about the specific text in these messages.
        If someone ever changed the text of the log message, you would have to update your log search tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        But if we had logs that looked like this, we could more easily process the log with a program:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
2021-07-06T09:25:17.813Z DEBUG foo_bar.js:56 ENTER {"function":"foo","id":"d44dcf8c-df41-11eb-9186-6723ffa51662"}
2021-07-06T09:25:18.501Z DEBUG foo_bar.js:68 STATE {"state":14}
2021-07-06T09:25:18.556Z DEBUG foo_bar.js:70 ILLSTATE</pre>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Understanding the intent of logging <i>should</i> help us make better systems.
        Separating telemetry (performance monitoring) log messages from debugging
