        I admit it. I have a bit of a HiFive habit. For
        those not in the know, "HiFive" is the name of a
        family of single board computers featuring
        RISC-V processors. The HiFive1 looks somewhat
        like an Arduino and features a 32-bit "embedded"
        SoC. The HiFive Unleashed is it's beefier
        cousin. It features a 64-bit penta-core system
        with a bunch of DRAM and runs Linux.
      </p>

      <p>
        But they both have a couple things in
        common. Firstly, they both use the same FTDI USB
        to UART chip. Secondly, it's my job to support
        both of them, so I frequently have two (or more)
        of these devices plugged in to my Linux system
        at the same time. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a problem because they don't report
        serial numbers during enumeration, making it
        hard to assign each board to its own unique,
        human-memorable device file name. In other
        words, I want the HiFive1 to show up as
        <strong>/dev/hifive1</strong> when I plug it in
        and the HiFive Unleashed to show up as
        <strong>/dev/hifiveu</strong>. But if you do a
        bit of googling on udev (Linux's userland device
        subsystem) you can find plenty of examples for
        how to do this...
        <strong><em>if the devices report unique serial
          numbers</em></strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a bit of experimentation and reading, I
        discovered it was possible to assign human
        memorable device names based on
        <strong><em>which port you plugged it
          into</em></strong>. This isn't an ideal
        situation, but it's good enough. Here's what I
        did:
      </p>

      <p>
        First, install the
        <strong>99-openocd.rules</strong> file as
        described in the HiFive1 or HiFive Unleashed
        getting started guide (links below.) This
        essentially involves copying this udev "rules
        file" into
        <strong>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-openocd.rules</strong>:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ATTR{idVendor}=="0403",ATTR{idProduct}=="6010",MODE="664",GROUP="plugdev"</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>SUBSYSTEM=="tty",ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403",ATTRS{idProduct}=="6010",MODE="664",GROUP="plugdev"</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        And copy the following lines into the file
        <strong>/dev/udev/rules.d/60-import.rules</strong>
        if it's not there already:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>SUBSYSTEMS=="pci|usb|platform|acpi", IMPORT{builtin}="path_id_tag"</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Now plug in your first device. You should see
        two devices appear: /dev/ttyUSB0 and
        /dev/ttyUSB1. The first is the device used by
        OpenOCD to communicate with the JTAG interface
        on the board while the second is the interface
        to the device's UART. That's the one I want to
        hide behind a unique device name.
      </p>

      <p>
        Type in the command:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>udevadm info -q all /dev/ttyUSB1 | grep ID_PATH_TAG</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        You should get a response something like this:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>E: ID_PATH_TAG=pci-usb-0_1_1_2_1_1</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        It may not be exactly the same, but as long as
        it's unique for each USB port on your device,
        it's fine. Now go back to the
        <strong>99-openocd.rules</strong> file and add
        this to the end of the line that starts with
        <strong>SUBSYSTEM="tty"</strong>:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>,SYMLINK+="sifive_$env{ID_PATH_TAG}"</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Now plug your device back in and look at newly
        formed devices in <strong>/dev</strong>:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>ls -l /dev/sifive_*</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        You should see a device that looks like this:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Aug 16 18:26 /dev/sifive_pci-usb-0_1_1_2_1_1 -> ttyUSB1</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        It's okay if you see multiple "sifive" devices,
        all we care about is that they're unique and map
        to a particular hardware USB port. Now that
        we've told the udev subsystem to create a unique
        link for tty devices that plug into a particular
        port, we can use that name as a target for a
        more human memorable name by manually creating a
        symlink.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this example, I connected my HiFive1 to this
        port, so I created a "hifive1" symbolic link to
        this first device:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>ln -s sifive_pci-0000_39_00_0-usb-0_1_1_2_1_1 hifive1</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Now as long as I plug my HiFive1 into the same
        port, it's serial interface will show up as
        <strong>/dev/hifive1</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can repeat this process with other HiFive1
        devices, perhaps naming them
        <strong>/dev/hifive1-1</strong> or
        <strong>/dev/hifive1-2</strong> and so on or add
        other symbolic links for the HiFive Unleashed
        board (which also uses the same FTDI chipset.)
