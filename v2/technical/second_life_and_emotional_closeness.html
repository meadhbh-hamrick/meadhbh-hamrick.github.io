        <em>[This article originally appeared on my blog
          in June 2010. -Ed.]</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        So the recent tumult at Linden Lab
        <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a> got me thinking about
        the lab, Second Life
        <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a>, virtual worlds in
        general, people's brains and business. And
        Apple <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a>; i live in the
        bay area, so when the subject turns to "turn
        around stories" we start talking about Apple.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, you know.. Apple. The people who make the
        iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTouch and
        iEverythingElse. It's hard to believe, but there
        was a time when apple products were the domain
        of artists, students and assorted nut-cases like
        me who just wanted to be annoyingly
        different. Before the iPod, apple's profits came
        from selling half-rate knock-offs of the Xerox
        Alto system software wrapped around well
        designed, but marginally manufactured hardware
        (until they started selling half-rate knock-offs
        of the Xerox Alto system software wrapped around
        Avi Tevanian's master's thesis micro-kernel
        wrapped around well designed, but not completely
        marginally manufactured hardware.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a wintel bigot;
        nor am i an apple hater. I'm just telling it a
        little bit like it is to make a point. In the
        1990's and early 2000's, you were a fool to
        waste time with Macintosh products. They were
        temperamental, expensive closed boxes and using
        them set you off from the wider community of PC
        users and the bazillion programs you could run
        under Microsoft Windows.
      </p>

      <p>
        As much as Guy Kawasaki likes talking about how
        the early mac team was trying to build something
        "Insanely Great," the Mac operating system
        rested too much on it's laurels. Throughout the
        late 1980's and 1990's, Apple's Steve-Jobs-less
        leadership frittered away it's leadership
        position shuffling business units, preparing
        them to be the "next new thing." While the
        public was introduced to a stream of
        "interesting" products like the Newton, PowerCD,
        QuickTake, CyberDog, OpenDoc, Pippin and
        MacintoshTV.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the mid-90's, Apple's arch-nemesis to the
        north was nipping on their heels with Windows-95
        and MS Office. The good news for apple was the
        decision to build user centered software with
        GUIs instead of crufty command sequences was
        vindicated. The bad news was that the courts
        allowed Microsoft to rip off apple's look and
        feel (which was really largely Xerox's look and
        feel, but let's not go down that rabbit-hole.)
      </p>

      <p>
        And then Steve Jobs returned from the corporate
        hinterland, slashing projects, killing divisions
        and laying off staff. At the time, apple
        employees had a term for it, it was called
        "steve-ing." as in... "Wow. They laid off the
        kitchen staff for Mariani 1, i think Imaging
        Products Division is going to get steved."
      </p>

      <p>
        So Jobs came back, turned apple around and today
        iPads are flying off the shelf and jobs hob-nobs
        with guys who can launch nuclear missiles at the
        Google campus.
      </p>

      <p>
        But what changed? Why are apple products now
        cool? (Yes, this is where we start talking about
        Second Life)
      </p>

      <p>
        Apple products are cool because Apple products
        appeal to both a user's need for functionality
        AND the user's emotional closeness to the
        experience of using those products. Apple
        products are cool. They delight. When you use
        them, they treat you like a movie star. They
        make you the center of their little device
        universe. They are cool and that coolness rubs
        off on you. So no matter how much of a dork you
        are, if you're using an iPhone, you feel like
        one of the cool kids. [At least this is how
        Apple products were perceived in the late
        2000's. -Ed.]
      </p>

      <p>
        Can we say that about linden lab products now?
      </p>

      <p>
        Okay. Loaded question. Let me ask it another
        way. How does second life have to change to
        bring back that sense of emotional closeness?
      </p>

      <p>
        Back in 2005 and 2006, the hype cycle was in
        full swing. Everyone was convinced that this was
        the wave of the future and we would soon all be
        virtually working in our virtual offices. So you
        couldn't teleport or you crashed every 15
        minutes or the whole grid had to reboot every
        Thursday? It wasn't a problem because you were
        experiencing "the future." And when you
        participated in the future, it made you cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the future was a reasonably crappy place to
        work. Prototyping real products in Second Life
        was annoying at best, and often impossible. You
        could have a virtual PC on top of your virtual
        desk in your virtual office, but it was just a
        prop. You couldn't use it to collaboratively
        edit documents with people in your virtual crib
        until very, very recently.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second Life was a taste of the future; distance
        would soon be a thing of the past. We would have
        meaningful human interaction virtually.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the promise of Second Life wasn't enough to
        keep the broader community of technology
        innovators "emotionally engaged." That a core
        group of enthusiasts drove the content creation
        economy with such primitive tools is testament
        to the creativity and ability of Second Life's
        residents.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the broader community of content designers
        who wanted to use Second Life to build things
        that would interact with the outside world, or
        even live mostly in the reified world, the time
        to frustration was often much shorter than the
        time to delight. And when you have a tool that
        frustrates you more than it delights, it's hard
        to have emotional engagement.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that's where we're at now... Second Life is
        a pretty cool niche with a comparatively small
        community of people using it to build engaging
        experiences. For the last several years the
        business guys at linden have been trying to
        figure out how to break out of that niche.
      </p>

      <p>
        Philip Rosedale's return to the helm of linden
        has invigorated the community, and everyone
        seems to have a different opinion of how the
        world went wrong and a different narrative for
        restoring it to its former glory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some view Second Life as a "platform." That is,
        linden's value lies in it software. Either as a
        service (as it is now) or as a product (like
        SL/Enterprise), they say that untold riches
        await the lab if they could just figure out how
        to market it properly. To grow adoption, you
        simply reduce costs, develop new markets and
        watch the cash roll in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Others view Second Life as a "community." That
        is, it's value lies in it's community, waiting
        to be monetized with search and ad sales. Make
        it easier for facebook and twitter users to
        convert into Second Life users and watch the
        cash roll in.
      </p>

      <p>
        And some people point to Steve Jobs' success in
        converting apple from a maker of second-rate
        computers into a consumer electronics powerhouse
        and say the lab should adopt an "experience"
        strategy: engage customers and give them an
        experience that is emotionally meaningful for
        them. Perhaps that means enhancing the graphics
        capability or enhancing in-world music events.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the truth is, none of these approaches will
        work by itself. Linden and Second Life are at an
        inflection point, much like apple was in 1996
        before Steve Jobs returned to re-orient the
        company. Apple had it's strategic
        re-organization that involved layoffs and
        management changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        But one thing to consider is it took Steve Jobs
        about five years from the time he returned to
        the time the iPod was released. So even if
        linden is pointing in the right direction, it
        could be years before we see the next big thing
        out of the lab.
