        <em>[ This article appeared on my blog on April
          13th, 2010, -Ed. ]</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        It's no secret VWRAP <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a> is
        heavily influenced by  Second Life's next
        generation OGP protocol <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a>.
        One view of how the OGP effort became the VWRAP
        working group can be found in "Notes on the
        History of the VWRAP Working Group."
        <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a> It's not surprising
        many people believe every feature of Second
        Life™ will be found in the VWRAP protocol suite.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this isn't the case; there will be many
        features of Linden's virtual world that won't be
        found in VWRAP. in this post, we're going to
        look at the VWRAP charter
        <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>, a recent presentation
        by josh bell <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a>, and talk about why it's not
        a big deal some things are left out. But let's
        start with what's in and what's out.
      </p>

      <p>
        What follows is a list of features that are
        widely believed to be "in" and "out." This is
        not an authoritative list; the feature list will
        only be official when the internet drafts
        describing VWRAP become RFCs. There's still time
        to influence the VWRAP protocol suite; join the
        vwrap@ietf.org <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a> mailing
        list and make your voice heard.

      <h2>What's In : Authentication and Trust</h2>

      <p>
        The first step a client application should take
        when dealing with the virtual world is to
        authenticate themselves. In VWRAP the
        authentication process begins with the
        presentation of credentials and ends with the
        client application receiving a "seed capability"
        or "seed cap." You can find more information
        about this process in the "VWRAP Trust Model and
        User Authentication" <a href="#ref_6">[6]</a>
        draft.
      </p>

      <p>
        The seed cap is a randomly generated, difficult
        to guess web address (URL.) When queried it
        returns information about where to find other
        services (like how to place your avatar in a
        region or manipulate your inventory.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Some members of the VWRAP mailing list have
        suggested that a virtual world open to anyone
        without authentication would be a productive use
        of the protocol. To support this use case, the
        authenticator in an authentication message is
        optional. The protocol does not require an
        authenticator like a hashed password to
        accompany a login message, but the virtual world
        you connect to might.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's also been pointed out that using Transport
        Layer Security (TLS) client certificates, OAuth
        or even HTTP authentication may be useful in
        some situations. It may be more accurate to call
        the "authentication" phase more of an
        "identification with optional authentication"
        phase.
      </p>

      <p>
        No matter what technique you use to successfully
        authenticate your client application to your
        authentication service, after it's over, the
        client has a seed capability and the
        authentication service has enough information to
        identify the client's user.
      </p>

      <h2>What's In : Inventory, Assets and Basic Permissions</h2>

      <p>
        Developers should expect a "streamlined" asset
        system. There is a requirement to maintain
        positive copy control on objects for users who
        want such control. But the existing inventory /
        asset system used in Second Life™ is starting to
        show it's age.
      </p>

      <p>
        Assets in VWRAP will be represented as LLSD
        maps, retrieved using resources defined using
        the LLIDL interface description language, most
        likely over HTTP. An "asset" in VWRAP is a
        collection of meta-data and data. The "data" of
        an asset is tightly constrained by the asset's
        type: cubes are represented by cube data;
        textures with texture data; etc. Asset meta-data
        will identify the creator, describe base
        permissions, and include textual descriptions of
        the object. Assets will use URLs to reference
        other assets, and not UUIDs. for example, when a
        cube references a texture for each of it's
        faces, it will use URLs to point to the
        textures.
      </p>

      <p>
        The SimianGrid project <a href="#ref_7">[7]</a>,
        which was born out of the Cable Beach Asset
        Server, has announced they will be participating
        in the development of the VWRAP inventory and
        asset system. Linden Research has not made a
        public statement of support of VWRAP inventory,
        but is expected to participate in it's
        development.
      </p>

      <p>
        It should also be mentioned that regions could
        have region-specific assets. ground textures,
        the shape of buildings, etc. All might be stored
        in an asset server associated with the region
        and not with the user who created them.
      </p>

      <h2>What's In : Spatial, User-to-User and Group Text and Voice</h2>

      <p>
        Text chat in Second Life's legacy protocol is
        mildly broken. Spatial chat has reasonable
        performance, but uses the same protocol to carry
        text chat as to carry friend requests, inventory
        offers and such-like. Group chat performance is
        much worse, mostly the result of an arcane
        architecture involving routing chat messages
        though a simulator on the way to the user's
        viewer. Simplification and performance
        enhancement is expected in both spatial and
        group text chat.
      </p>

      <p>
        VWRAP will define a service for spatial,
        user-to-user and group text chat. There has been
        significant interest in using XMPP (or other
        established IM protocols) to carry text
        chat. This is a natural fit for user-to-user and
        group text chat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Voice is expected to work in radically the same
        way, but using SIP and RTP protocols instead of
        XMPP.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's In : Basic Agent Information</h2>

      <p>
        This does not mean "profile info." Basic
        information would likely include very basic
        presence information like "this user is logged
        in" or "you can find this agent in this region."
        Basic agent information is there to support
        other protocol functions (like teleportation and
        retrieving avatar shape info.)
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's In : Teleport and Region Crossing</h2>

      <p>
        Teleportation has changed radically from the
        Second Life legacy protocol. The biggest change
        is the idea that an agent's presence information
        can potentially be stored in two locations. OGP
        experimented with the idea that agent-oriented
        services should be segregated from
        simulation-oriented services. So if you wanted
        to know what region a user's avatar was rezzed
        in, you would query a service associated with
        that user, not with the region.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember, in the OGP world, there may be several
        organizations that operate simulation
        regions. Querying each of them to ask, "is this
        avatar located here?" is sub-optimal.
      </p>

      <p>
        This means that BOTH agent oriented services and
        region oriented services need to know where the
        user's avatar is. VWRAP is proposing extending
        the OGP Draft 5 Teleport specification
        <a href="#ref_8">[8]</a> to manage the intricate
        dance of moving an agent from one region to
        another.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's In : Avatar Shape Information</h2>

      <p>
        We mentioned above that an agent's avatar will
        be available through the basic agent info
        service. it's unclear now what format avatar
        meshes will take. The existing Linden legacy
        format could be used. As could MPEG-V's ADML
        (avatar data markup language.) Or maybe both.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whatever the format, a user's avatar will be
        made available to both client applications and
        simulation services.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's In : the Scene Graph and Object Updates</h2>

      <p>
        When your avatar is rezzed into a region, the
        user's client application may pull a description
        of the scene graph. That is, the list of 3d
        objects observable in a given field of view.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several ways to communicate this
        information. For instance, the simulator could
        package up references to all items in the
        avatar's field of view and send it to the client
        as one large chunk. Or it could just start
        sending a stream of messages; one message per
        object.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the past, object update messages have been
        carried over raw UDP. In the future, object
        updates may be carried over RTP or an HTTP event
        queue.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's In : Object Presence and Physics Simulation</h2>

      <p>
        Objects in the virtual world persist. once
        they're rezzed, they should stay where they are
        until acted upon by an external force. "Object
        presence" services will allow a client to query
        objects rezzed in the world for information like
        internal state, an object control channel (if
        you have rights to control it), etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Objects that are subject to physical simulation
        may be moved or rotated by the simulation
        software running on the region they're rezzed
        in.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the fundamental features of VWRAP is that
        physics simulation happens centrally. That is,
        we don't do co-simulation where each client
        simulates physical interactions and then check
        with each other to see if any clients are out of
        sync.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's In : Region Adjacency Information</h2>

      <p>
        Second Life regions are rectangles, 256 meters
        on a side in the x and y dimension and
        stretching to infinity along the z axis. Second
        Life itself is a collection of these regions
        arranged in a grid. VWRAP will likely NOT
        mandate this shape as the standard for virtual
        worlds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Proposals have surfaced that describe the
        virtual world with spherical, cylindrical and
        toroidal coordinates. But even flat "grids" may
        have non-rectangular regions in the future. to
        help client applications figure out which
        systems to query for object information, a
        service is needed to describe the shape and
        partitioning of the virtual world.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a map service per se, but something
        more fundamental. The virtual world is composed
        of multiple regions being stitched together to
        give the illusion of a seamless
        multi-dimensional space.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's In : Object and Avatar Control</h2>

      <p>
        A virtual world would be pretty boring if you
        couldn't move or animate your avatar. VWRAP will
        provide a simple, extensible protocol for
        sending control information to your avatar. The
        same protocol may be used to control other
        objects; think of virtual vehicles you climb in
        and drive.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's Out?</h2>

      <p>
        What's being left out of VWRAP is at least as
        interesting as what's going in. Here's a rundown
        of major Second Life features you won't find in
        the spec.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's Out : Game Script</h2>

      <p>
        Do not look for linden dollars in the VWRAP
        drafts; you won't find them. Or at least you
        won't find them now. Linden expressed a
        preference that the linden dollar interface not
        be made part of the official
        specification. There are multiple reasons why
        this could be the case. VWRAP is still a
        technology under construction; a design flaw in
        VWRAP could lead to a very real vulnerability
        costing thousands if not millions of
        dollars. Linden also charges a fee for linden
        dollar transactions. It is possible they want to
        maintain control of the specification for purely
        mercantile reasons; to prevent VWRAP from
        letting third parties to wedge into the linden
        dollar exchange business.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some OpenSim <a href="#ref_9">[9]</a> developers
        expressed a desire to prevent Linden from
        encroaching on their turf. Typical of their
        position is the statement, "why should i let
        Linden take a cut of my OpenSim based business?"
        The fear is that if a linden dollar API was
        included in the specifications, it would be
        considered mandatory. Many OpenSim grid
        operators would not accept a mandatory linden
        dollar economy.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is one of the most obvious places where
        business interest meets standards development,
        and it will be interesting to see what happens
        in the future. Maybe Linden will open up a
        private VWRAP-like API for trusted partners. If
        you're an OpenSim operator not focused on
        eCommerce, this may be something you would be
        interested in. Maybe third parties like two fish
        / live gamer <a href="#ref_10">[10]</a> will
        produce an alternative specification? It will
        certainly be interesting to watch the market
        develop.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's Out : Land Ownership</h2>

      <p>
        Before I start any rumors, I should say that
        Linden is NOT going to eliminate private land
        ownership on it's grid. Land ownership is not
        part of the VWRAP protocol suite because it's
        expected that different virtual worlds will
        manage land ownership differently.
      </p>

      <p>
        VWRAP clients are expected to be able to query a
        region for "information about the place my
        user's avatar is at right now" and get a URL to
        a human readable, HTML web page. If the region
        supports land ownership, the web page will list
        that info. But the land ownership schema from
        Second Life will not be forced on all VWRAP
        virtual worlds.
      </p>

      <p>
        This may be an issue for viewer
        developers. Different protocols for land
        management will require client developers to
        know how to query a region for information about
        if and how ownership is represented and how to
        present it to the user.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's Out : Building</h2>

      <p>
        So far there's been no mention of building as a
        use case for VWRAP. This doesn't mean it won't
        be supported, but it may be that building is
        handled by way of the generic object and avatar
        control protocol.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's Out : Media Attached to Prims</h2>

      <p>
        Second Life has had "parcel media" for a while
        and recently added the ability to add media to a
        prim face. To date, this use case hasn't been
        discussed at length in the VWRAP working
        group. This is not to say it's not important,
        but it may be that the participants are happy to
        develop this standard later; perhaps after
        seeing what happens with Linden's "media on a
        prim" feature.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's Out : Detailed Avatar and User Profiles</h2>

      <p>
        Second Life users are likely familiar with the
        standard user profile. Imagine the ability to
        extend your profile to include information YOU
        think is important. This is what we're hoping to
        achieve by moving the profile information out of
        the core protocol and rebuild it as a simple web
        application. In the future, expect seeing a HTML
        page with protocol information instead of a
        fixed "floater" window in your favorite
        viewer. About the only thing the core protocol
        will specify is how to find the URL to the HTML
        profile page.
      </p>

      <p>
        It sounds scary. but trust me; it'll be better.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why the Sky is Not Falling</h2>

      <p>
        Some Second Life™ users may have an uneasy
        feeling, hearing that important features like
        game script, building and profile management
        WON'T be in the VWRAP protocol.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don't Panic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just because a feature is not in the VWRAP
        specification, it doesn't mean that feature will
        disappear from Second Life or any other virtual
        world. What it means is that Linden and the
        OpenSim developers may diverge on how they want
        to implement those features.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lack of a feature in the specification means
        only that the participants could not find
        consensus on the feature's functionality. VWRAP
        will be complete enough to provide a rich
        experience. By agreeing to core functionality,
        it frees us to experiment with solutions for
        other, high-margin features.
      </p>

      <p>
        It will, however, make client application
        coder's lives a little more complicated. where
        Second Life and OpenSimulator diverge, viewer
        developers will have to know how to work with
        both systems. This isn't as bad as it might
        seem; Linden's stock viewer already uses well
        known techniques to cope with protocol
        divergence. But more on that later...
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, let me encourage readers to
        subscribe to the vwrap mailing list
        <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a> where these
        specifications are being discussed. What to
        leave in and what to take out will certainly be
        the subject of continuing discussions. If you
        don't speak up now, you don't get to complain
        later.
      </p>
