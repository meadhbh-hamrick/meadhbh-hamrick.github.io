        Today's VWRAP essentials post is for a more
        technical audience. If you're reading this, I'm
        going to assume you're familiar with VWRAP, the
        Virtual World Region Agent Protocol. if you need
        a refresher, you can look at "What is VWRAP?"
        <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a> post on this blog, read
        the VWRAP Working Group Charter
        <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a>, or read the latest
        draft of the "VWRAP : Intro and Goals"
        <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a> document.
      </p>

      <p>
        Early in the list of technical deliverables for
        the VWRAP working group is the document titled
        "Abstract Type System for the Transmission of
        Dynamic Structured Data."
        <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a> In this post we're
        going to answer the question "What is an
        abstract type system and why should I care?"
      </p>

      <h2>c? c++? python? c#? php? javascript?</h2>

      <p>
        There are a bunch of languages used by virtual
        world programmers. Which one should we
        standardize on? If you answered "we shouldn't
        standardize on any of them," then you gave the
        right answer. VWRAP is a wire protocol intended
        to be implementable by any language. If you can
        open a network socket and receive arbitrary HTTP
        requests, we're hoping you can use it to
        implement VWRAP.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this introduces a bit of a quandry. The type
        behavior of languages is mildly
        different. Integers in c are 32 bits in length,
        unless they're 16 or 64. JavaScript seems to not
        have a limit, transparently converting regular
        integers into multi-precision integers (except
        when it doesn't.) And in some languages the
        results of adding integers to strings isn't the
        same as others.
      </p>

      <p>
        While most languages provide a plethora of types
        (like integers, strings, dates, etc.) the rules
        for adding them together or converting them to
        other types are inconsistent. In normal
        development this isn't too much of a problem; on
        the rare occasion programmers have to code in
        different languages, there are frequently tools
        to manage the differences. These tools usually
        only work on a specific system, however. they're
        designed not to work in the general case, but
        tailored for a particular development
        environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's still really nice to be able to use
        familiar types like integers, strings, dates and
        so on when describing protocol messages. But if
        there's no easy way to convert between types
        used in different implementations, what do you
        do?

      <h2>The LLSD Abstract Type System</h2>

      <p>
        An early version of the LLSD abstract type
        system was introduced internally in 2005 and was
        intended to hide type system differences between
        C++, python and ruby based services. The intent
        was to store structured data independent of
        language-based type behavior. When a python
        program read data written by a C++ program, it
        would know what the rules were. Integers were
        ALWAYS 32 bits wide. Dates were ALWAYS stored in
        the same format; not a 32 bit int on some
        systems or a string on others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the past five years, LLSD has been refined
        somewhat, but the basic rules are the same:
        there are a fixed number of types that all
        languages SHOULD be able to understand. There
        are a fixed number of serialization formats
        (currently there are three) each with fixed
        rules about how data is serialized and later
        de-serialized.
      </p>

      <p>
        The benefit of this system is if you specify
        your abstract type system used to store or
        transmit data, and you make the serialization
        rules easy to implement, future programming
        languages, environments and operating systems
        should have minimal problems parsing the data.

      <h2>LLSD for the Impatient</h2>

      <p>
        The LLSD abstract type system defines 11 types:
        undefined, boolean, integer, real, string, date,
        URI, UUID, binary, array and map. The last two
        are "collections" meaning
        they're... well... they're collections of other
        types. Arrays are (as you might have guessed)
        collections indexed by position while maps are
        indexed by keys. The undefined type is present
        to represent situations where the existence of
        an item is implied, but there's not enough
        information to assign a type to a data
        element. An example of when you attempt to
        retrieve an array or map element that doesn't
        exist. Instead of getting an error, you get an
        undefined.
      </p>

      <p>
        LLSD defines conversions between types that your
        implementing language should support. type
        conversions will get more important later when
        we talk about the LLIDL interface description
        language and programming styles that support
        loosely coupled systems. But for now just know
        that if you really want to convert the type of a
        data element, that's fine, but LLSD has a few
        rules about the conversion.
      </p>

      <p>
        LLSD also defined default values for each
        type. Defaults surface when you make an illegal
        type conversion. so if you convert a date to a
        boolean, you'll get the boolean default value
        (false.) If you convert an undefined value into
        any other type, you get the default value for
        that type. So if you attempted to read past the
        end of an array and cast that value as an
        integer, you would get 0, the default integer.
      </p>

      <p>
        LLSD has three serialization schemes: XML, JSON
        and Binary. Each scheme is, in theory, no better
        than the other, but they were each designed for
        slightly different use cases. The XML
        serialization scheme is useful for environments
        that already use XML for other reasons. JSON is
        useful for web services and the Binary
        serialization scheme is useful for systems that
        need low message processing overhead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Better examples of serialized LLSD data can be
        found in the internet draft referenced above,
        but here is a very simple example of a map with
        three members: an integer, a string and an
        array:
      </p>

      <pre>

&lt;llsd&gt;
  &lt;map&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;name&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;Zocalo Merchants&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;priority&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;int&gt;12&lt;/int&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;position&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
      &lt;int&gt;128&lt;/int&gt;
      &lt;int&gt;192&lt;/int&gt;
      &lt;int&gt;20&lt;/int&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
  &lt;/map&gt;
&lt;/llsd&gt;</pre>

      <h2>Maddening Weirdness Can Be Your Friend</h2>

      <p>
        There has been some criticism of LLSD's behavior
        regarding undefined type conversions and what to
        do when accessing a non-existent collection
        element. There are some very good arguments in
        favor of raising an exception. The primary
        benefit is that if there's an error involving
        type conversion weirdness, developers are more
        likely to catch it if the system signals an
        exception rather than "fails silently."
      </p>

      <p>
        But there are two arguments against raising an
        execption. First, it's more complicated and
        requires that error handling be added to the
        abstract type system. Secondly, it may lead to
        redundant error checking and brittle systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        The argument goes something like this: "if i'm
        writing a service consuming an LLSD message, i'm
        probably going to be checking values at the
        application layer to make sure they make
        sense. if i'm checking them there, why do i need
        the presentation layer to check that they make
        sense?"
      </p>

      <p>
        This argument implies that erroring out when you
        find an "illegal" type conversion doesn't really
        buy you anything, and you would have to
        complicate the specification to support it.

      <p>
        So that's it. LLSD is a pretty small
        specification. There are already several oepn
        source implementations for the curious, and the
        most recent specification is available at the
        ietf.org web site. Please take a look at it and
        give us feedback on the
        <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/vwrap">vwrap
          mailing list</a>.
