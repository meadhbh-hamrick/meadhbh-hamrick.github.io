        <em>[ This article originally appeared on my
          blog on July 19th, 2010. -Ed. ]</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        I recently got an email from a VWRAP document
        reviewer asking if web capabilities could be
        considered "security by obscurity." the simple
        answer is, "no. as long as you treat a web
        capability as a one time use password for a
        resource, you should be fine."
      </p>

      <p>
        But i realized then there are a number of people
        who don't grok caps. If you're unfamiliar with
        the terms "capabilities" or "caps" or "webcaps,"
        this blog post may be for you. (Note, i'm
        cribbing a lot of the text of this post from an
        earlier message i wrote on the OGPX mailing list
        )

      <h2>What are capabilities anyway?</h2>

      <p>
        "Capabilities" are authorization tokens designed
        so that possession of the token implies the
        authority to perform a specific action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider a file handle in POSIX like systems;
        when you open a file, you get back an integer
        representing the open file. You only get this
        file handle back if you have access rights to
        the file. When you spawn a new child process,
        the child inherits your open file handles and it
        too can access those files via the file handle,
        even though the child process lives in a
        completely different process space. Later
        versions of *nix even allow you to move open
        file handles between unrelated processes. So the
        takeaway here is, it's an opaque bit of data
        (i.e. - a token) and if you have it, it means
        you have the authority to use it. And you can
        pass it around if need be.
      </p>

      <p>
        Capabilities on the web extend the concept. In
        addition to the token implying authorization to
        access some resource, it usually also provides
        the address to access the resource. In other
        words, a web capability is a URL possessed by a
        client that the client may use to create, read,
        update or delete a resource.
      </p>

      <p>
        Web Capabilities in VWRAP are in the form of a
        "well known" portion of a URL (something like
        "http://service.example.org/s/") and a large,
        unguessable, randomly generated string (like
        "CE7A3EA0-2948-405D-A699-AA9F6293BDFE".) Putting
        them together, you get a valid URL a client can
        use to access a resource via HTTP. In this
        example, that URL would be
        "http://service.example.org/s/CE7A3EA0-2948-405D-A699-AA9F6293BDFE".
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why the Heck Would I Ever Want To Do That?</h2>

      <p>
        No doubt about it, this is not a "standard
        pattern" for web services. Normally, if you have
        a resource, you publish a well known resource
        for it and if it's sensitive you require the
        client to log in prior to being granted access.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, you might have a RESTful resource
        at
        "http://service.example.org/s/group/AWGroupies"
        representing the group "AWGroupies". You define
        an API that says if you want to post a message
        to the group, you use HTTP POST with data (XML,
        JSON or whatever) implying the semantic "post
        this message to this group". for the sake of
        discussion, let's say the message looks like:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   {
     from: "Meadhbh Oh",
     message: "I'm giving 50 L$ to anyone who IMs me in the next 5 minutes!"
   }
</pre>

      <p>
        Authentication is in order here, but this is a
        well known problem, I simply use HTTP digest
        auth over HTTPS (or something similar) and we're
        done. This is a perfectly acceptable solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        But there are a couple of issues with this
        solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most notabrly, every service that presents an
        interface to a sensitive resource MUST
        understand authentication. so not only does
        "http://service.example.org/s/group/AWGroupies"
        need to understand authentication, so does
        "http://service.example.org/s/user/Oh/Meadhbh"
        and
        "http://service.example.org/s/parcel/Levenhall/Infinity%20is%20full%20of%stars"
        and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's not a problem really, until you start
        adding new authentication techniques. One day
        your boss comes to you and tells you. "Hey!
        We're using Secure/IDs for everything now!"
        Ugh. but it's still not that painful. You've
        probably abstracted out authentication, so you
        have a map of service URLs to authentication
        techniques and common libraries that actually
        authenticate requests throughout your system.
      </p>

      <p>
        This works until the day that your boss comes in
        and says... "Hey! We just bought our competitor
        cthulhos.com! We're going to integrate their
        FooWidget service into our service offering!
        isn't it great!" and then you get that sinking
        feeling cause you know that this means you've
        got to figure a way to get their service to talk
        to your identity provider so their service can
        authenticate your customers. People who have
        gone through this know that this can turn out to
        be a bag full of pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        The standard way of doing this is something
        like:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>service request come into http://service.example.org/s/foo/Meadhbh</li>
        <li>http://service.example.org/s/foo/ redirects with a 302 to http://foo.cthulhos.com/Meadhbh</li>
        <li>http://foo.cthulhos.com/Meadhbh responds with a 401 getting the client to resubmit the request with a WWW-Authenticate: header.</li>
        <li>the client resubmits to http://foo.cthulhos.com/Meadhbh with the proper WWW-Authenticate: header, but remember, these are example.org's customers, so</li>
        <li>http://foo.cthulhos.com/Meadhbh sends a message to a private interface on example.org, asking it to authenticate the user credentials.</li>
        <li>assuming the client is using valid credentials, example.org responds to cthulhos.com with the digital equivalent of a thumbs up, and finally...</li>
        <li>http://foo.cthulhos.com/Meadhbh responds to the request.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        And this works pretty well up until the point
        that the new CIO comes in and says, "Infocard!
        we're moving everything to Infocard!" There's
        nothing wrong with Infocard, of course, but in
        this situation you've got to implement it at
        both example.org and cthulhos.com. And when we
        start adding to the mix the fact that the biz
        dev people keep trying to buy new companies and
        you get a new CIO every 18 months who wants a
        new user authentication technology, things can
        get out of hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        And i didn't even talk about the fact that each
        time you change the authentication scheme, thick
        client developers have to go through the code,
        looking for every place a request is made.
      </p>

      <p>
        Web capabilities are not a magic panacea, but
        they can help out in this situation. Rather than
        having each request authenticated, the user's
        identity is authenticated once at a central
        location (like example.org) it coordinates with
        it's services (cthulhos.com) to provide a
        unique, unguessable URL (the capability) known
        only to that specific client and trusted systems
        (example.org and cthulhos.com)
      </p>

      <p>
        So the flow would be something like...
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>a client logs in at http://service.example.org/s/authme and asks for a capability to use a particular service</li>
        <li>http://service.example.org/s/authme verifies the user's credentials and verifies the user can access that service</li>
        <li>http://service.example.org/s/authme sends a request to a private interface on cthulhos.com asking for the capability.</li>
        <li>cthulhos.com generates the unguessable capability http://foo.cthulhos.com/EE409B12-6E9B-4F5B-90BF-161AE5DE410C and returns it to http://service.example.org/s/authme</li>
        <li>http://service.example.org/s/authme returns the capability http://foo.cthulhos.com/EE409B12-6E9B-4F5B-90BF-161AE5DE410C to the client</li>
        <li>the client uses the capability http://foo.cthulhos.com/EE409B12-6E9B-4F5B-90BF-161AE5DE410C to access the sensitive resource.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Both approaches require establishing a trusted
        interface between example.org and cthulhos.com,
        but in the case of the capability example, only
        service.example.org has to know about the
        specific details of user authentication. Thick
        client developers may also notice that they
        access the capability as if it were a public
        resource; that is, they don't need to
        authenticate each request.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another benefit to capabilities is that they are
        pre-authorized. If you have a resource that is
        accessed frequently (like maybe "get the next 10
        inventory items" or "check to see if there are
        any messages on the event queue for me") you
        don't have to do the username -> permissions
        look up each time the server receives a
        request. For environments where the server makes
        a network request for each permissions check,
        this can lead to reduced request latency.
      </p>

      <p>
        Capabilities are not magic panaceas. There's
        still some work involved in implementing them
        and they start making a lot more sense when you
        have a cluster of machines offering service to a
        client, but deployers want identity and identity
        to permissions mapping functions to live
        elsewhere in the network than the machine
        offering a service. (i.e. - "the cloud" or "the
        grid".)

      <h2>But How Do I Provision a Capability ?</h2>

      <p>
        There are several ways to provision
        capabilities, but the approach we take in VWRAP
        is to use the "seed capability."
      </p>

      <p>
        Like many other distributed protocols involving
        sensitive resources, VWRAP interactions begin
        with user authentication. This is not strictly
        true; i'm ignoring the case where two machines
        want to communicate outside the context of a
        user request, but let me hand wave that use case
        away for the moment while we talk about using
        seed caps.
      </p>

      <p>
        The process begins with user authentication. The
        VWRAP authentication specification describes
        this process; the client sends an avatar name
        and a password to an authentication
        server. assuming the authentication request can
        be validated, the server returns a "seed cap."
        The client then sends a list of capability names
        to the seed cap and awaits the response.
      </p>

      <p>
        What the host behind the seed cap is doing while
        the client waits for a reply is verifying the
        requested capability exists and the user is
        permitted to perform the operation implied by
        the capability (and it does this for each
        capability requested.)
      </p>

      <p>
        So, for example, let's say you are a client that
        only wants to update a user profile and
        send/receive group messages. the protocol
        interaction might look something like this...
      </p>

      <p>
        a. authentication : client -> server at
        https://example.org/login
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   {
     agent_name: "Meadhbh Oh",
     authenticator: {
       type: "hash",
       algorithm: "md5",
       secret: "i1J8B0rOmekRn8ydeup6Dg=="
     }
   }</pre>

      <p>
        b. auth response : server ->; client
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   {
     condition: "success",
     agent_seed_capability: "https://example.org/s/CF577955-3E0D-4299-8D13-F28345D843F3"
   }</pre>

      <p>
        c. asking the seed for the other caps : client
        -> server at
        https://s.example.org/s/CF577955-3E0D-4299-8D13-F28345D843F3
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   {
     capabilities : [
       "profile/update",
       "groups/search"
     ]
   }</pre>

      <p>
        d. the response with the URIs for the caps :
        server -> client
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   {
     capabilities : {
       profile/update : "http://service.example.org/user/35A59C5D-315C-4D50-B78D-A38D41D2C90A",
       groups/search : "http://cthulhos.com/8579CE1F-9C05-43E8-8677-A645859DCD64"
     }
   }</pre>

      <h2>Expiring Capabilities</h2>

      <p>
        Readers may notice that there is a potential
        "TOCTOU vulnerability." TOCTOU stands for "time
        of check, time of use," and refers to a common
        security problem. What happens if the
        permissions on an object change between the time
        the code managing the resource checks the
        permission and the time it performs an operation
        on the resource.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a common problem with many systems,
        including POSIX file
        descriptors. (seriously.. if you change the
        permissions on a file to disallow writing AFTER
        the file has been opened, subsequent writes on
        the file descriptor will not fail in many POSIX
        systems.)
      </p>

      <p>
        VWRAP addresses this problem by expiring
        capabilities when they get old. So if you
        request a capability, then wait a LONG time
        before you access it, you may find you get a 404
        response. The VWRAP specifications do not
        require all caps to expire, but the do require
        servers to signal their expiration by removing
        them (thus the 404 response) and require clients
        to understand what to do when a capability has
        been expired. In most cases, the appropriate
        response is to re-request the capability from
        the seed cap. If the seed cap is expired,
        clients should re-authenticate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Capabilities may also "expire after first use."
        Also called "single shot capabilities," they are
        used to communicate sensitive or highly volatile
        information to the client.
      </p>

      <p>
        Current practice is to include an Expires:
        header in the response from the server so the
        client will know when the resource expires.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introspection on Capabilities</h2>

      <p>
        Finally, RESTful resources represented by a
        capability are described by an abstract
        interface (like LLIDL), the interface
        description language described in the VWRAP
        Abstract Type System draft. Several people have
        requested introspection so clients may request
        the LLIDL description of a capability and more
        accurately reason about the semantics of its
        use.
      </p>

      <p>
        The proposed solution to this problem for VWRAP
        messages carried over HTTP is to use the OPTIONS
        method when accessing the capability (instead of
        GET, POST, PUT or DELETE.) upon receipt of the
        OPTIONS request, the server should respond with
        the LLIDL describing the resource.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Capabilities are cool, especially in clouds or
        grids.
