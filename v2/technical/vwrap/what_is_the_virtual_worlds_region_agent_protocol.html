      <p>
        I recently had the pleasure of talking with
        Maria Korolov at HypergridBusiness.Com.
        <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a> She was interested in
        understanding the differences between Hypergrid
        and VWRAP. (Who knows, maybe there will be a
        story about it in the near future?) But this got
        me thinking; there are very few places an
        interested non-specialist can go to learn about
        VWRAP, it's goals and approach to virtual
        worlds. This blog post is an effort to fill that
        gap.
      </p>

    <a name=""01_What_Is_VWRAP"></a>
    <section id="01_What_Is_VWRAP">
      <h2>What is VWRAP?</h2>

      <p>
        The Virtual World Region Agent Protocol (aka
        VWRAP) is an application layer wire protocol
        used to create "inter-operable virtual
        experiences." It is also the name of the working
        group inside the Internet Engineering Task Force
        (IETF) developing the protocol.
      </p>

      <p>
        Okay... that's a mouthful; let's break it down.
      </p>

      <p>
        A "wire protocol" is a set of conventions and
        standards describing data flowing over a
        network. HTTP for instance, or SMTP are both
        wire protocols; they describe the format of
        messages web browsers or email clients
        generate. A protocol doesn't equal an
        implementation. The Apache web server, for
        instance, implements the HTTP protocol, but does
        not define it. So it is with VWRAP virtual
        worlds: the protocol lists what data is
        exchanged in between systems cooperating to
        "create" the virtual world. VWRAP is expected to
        be implemented by server software at Linden Lab
        <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a>, the OpenSimulator
        project <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a> and SimianGrid
        (formerly Cable Beach.) <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        We say that it's an "Application Layer Protocol"
        because it makes use of familiar net protocols
        for moving information around. That is, VWRAP
        messages are carried by HTTP and (possibly) RTP,
        the protocols responsible for the web and VoIP.
      </p>

      <p>
        And what's an "inter-operable virtual
        experience?" This just means that virtual world
        viewers can use VWRAP protocols to simulate a
        virtual world shared by multiple participants. i
        like to say "virtual experiences" these days as
        I've been involved in some pretty heated debates
        as to what the term "Virtual World" means.
      </p>

      <p>
        So VWRAP is a protocol and a community of people
        working to build systems that let users have a
        "Second Life-Like" experience, but in an "open"
        virtual world. That is, you can have an
        experience that looks like Second Life, but does
        not require your virtual locations or virtual
        belongings to be hosted by machines owned by
        Linden Lab.
      </p>

    <a name=""02_Why_is_VWRAP_not"></a>
    <section id="02_Why_is_VWRAP_not">
      <h2>Why is VWRAP not like Hypergrid or OpenWonderland or Croquet or ... ?</h2>

      <p>
        There are several virtual worlds out there
        ranging from the game-like World of Warcraft™ to
        the open-ended Second Life™. Some are open
        source projects like Croquet
        <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>, RealXtend
        <a href="#ref_6">[6]</a>, OpenWonderland
        <a href="#ref_7">[7]</a> or OpenSimulator
        <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a>. Others are
        commercial services like ReactionGrid
        <a href="#ref_8">[8]</a> or cooperatives like
        OSGrid. <a href="#ref_9">[9]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        VWRAP is not an implementation or (like
        Hypergrid <a href="#ref_10">[10]</a>) an
        extension to an existing implementation. It is
        an open protocol, developed by a community of
        interested parties with the intent that anyone
        can choose to implement it. So VWRAP will not be
        a new product, but likely a new feature to
        existing implementations and services that will
        make it easier for them to communicate with each
        other (though there are sure to be "sample
        implementations" of the VWRAP specifications.)
      </p>

      <p>
        VWRAP is "Second Life-Like" in that it assumes a
        virtual world somewhat like Second Life™ or one
        created with OpenSimulator. World of Warcraft™,
        Croquet and OpenWonderland use protocols that
        are significantly different from the ones for
        Second Life-Like worlds. And the way they think
        avatars will interact is a little
        different. It's not impossible for these systems
        to use VWRAP, but they're not what VWRAP was
        intended to support (though there may be ways
        for these systems to use pieces of VWRAP; more
        on this later.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Another important feature about VWRAP: some
        people will consider it incomplete. The people
        behind VWRAP chose to NOT standardize certain
        features of virtual worlds. VWRAP does not
        include standards relating to eCommerce or "game
        script" like linden dollars. Nor does it
        describe standards for virtual land ownership
        like Second Life's parcels and estates.
      </p>

      <p>
        It does, however, make it easy to define new
        services and to extend existing services. so it
        should be pretty easy to extend Linden Lab's
        SnowGlobe viewer (and other open source viewers)
        to support different, world-specific eCommerce
        and land ownership features. You may not get to
        use linden dollars on OSGrid, but if a region
        owner wants to support something else, it should
        be pretty easy for the viewer developers to code
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, virtual worlds users should find
        the software they use get a little more robust
        and should see new features emerge a little
        faster.
      </p>

      <p>
        So to recap: VWRAP is a set of protocols, not an
        implementation. VWRAP protocols are expected to
        not only be the basis for new products, but also
        to be added to existing systems as extensions.

    <section id="03_What_is_the_IETF">
      <h2>What is the IETF and Why is it Important to this Discussion?</h2>

      <p>
        The internet engineering task force (IETF)
        <a href="#ref_11">[11]</a> is a "standards
        development organization" which focuses on
        internet protocols. It is well known for being
        the professional forum where TCP/IP (a very
        popular networking technology) and SMTP (the
        standard email protocol) were developed. the
        IETF is not a commercial organization; it's more
        like a non-profit or NGO. it's stated goal is to
        improve people's lives by making network
        equipment and software work together.
      </p>

      <p>
        An interesting feature of the IETF is that when
        protocols are developed under it's auspices,
        they're considered "open" and "public." That is,
        there is no charge to implement them. you don't
        have to sign non-disclosure agreements and you
        don't have to pay money to download
        them. membership in the working groups that
        define standards is open to the public; anyone
        can participate. When Linden and IBM approached
        the IETF saying they wanted to develop a "next
        generation" protocol as an IETF activity, they
        were explicitly agreeing to public commentary
        and participation in the process.
      </p>

      <p>
        That being said, there are some intellectual
        property issues. Apecifically, there is a patent
        held by IBM that may or may not have bearing on
        the implementation of VWRAP services. The IETF
        process requires participants to disclose any
        known patents related to the work. This allows
        developers to decide if they want to participate
        or agree to make a standard that may be covered
        by software patents. in this case, IBM filed the
        requisite disclosure <a href="#ref_12">[12]</a>
        and has offered VWRAP developers a blanket
        license to use their intellectual property for
        the purpose of implementing the VWRAP
        standard(s). i am not a lawyer, however. You
        should get competent legal authority to verify
        what i just wrote.

      <h2>How Will We Know If We've Succeeded?</h2>

      <p>
        There's been a little confusion about what we're
        trying to do with VWRAP. we're not trying to
        compete with Hypergrid or Croquet or
        OpenWonderland. rather, we're trying to define
        the protocol for services that anyone could
        implement, even 2d web services.
      </p>

      <p>
        We'll know we've succeeded when after publishing
        our specifications, users can log into virtual
        worlds using their twitter or WikiMedia account
        credentials. Or if they're able to use the
        WikiMedia commons as an asset server. Or if they
        can teleport between OSGrid and Second Life™.

    <section id="05_How_Can_You_Help">
      <h2>How Can You Help?</h2>

      <p>
        The VWRAP working group is made up predominantly
        of implementers. That is, people who write
        software are disproportionately represented. We
        need more input from people who deploy virtual
        worlds and from people who live in them. Most of
        the discussions will be highly technical in
        nature, and that might be intimidating to some.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it is an open process; everyone is welcome
        to listen to the discussion. As long as you're
        not abusive to other list participants, you are
        welcome to post comments or questions. Keep in
        mind that the answers may not be exactly what
        you want to hear, and questions should be
        focused on the technology (and not Linden or
        OSGrid policy.) But as technology developers, we
        need to know what your use cases are.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mailing list for this group is
        vwrap@ietf.org <a href="#ref_13">[13]</a>. A
        good place to start is by  reading the "Intro
        and Goals" <a href="#ref_14">[14]</a> internet
        draft.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope this answers a few questions about the
        VWRAP protocol and working group.
