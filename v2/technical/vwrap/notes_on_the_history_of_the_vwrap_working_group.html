      <p>
        After my last post about VWRAP, a couple people
        pinged me asking about it's history. Here is a
        quick narrative of how VWRAP came to be and
        where it might be headed next.
      </p>

      <p>
        The effort to establish the VWRAP working group
        has been ongoing for about a year, and it has a
        surprisingly rich history for an effort that's
        been ongoing for that short of a period of
        time. <em>[This post was originally dated April
        7th, 2010, -ed]</em> Our group is certainly not
        the first attempt to develop inter-operable
        virtual worlds standards; that's been going on
        for quite a while.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        VWRAP recent history begins with an
        interoperability test sponsored by IBM and
        Linden Lab in the summer of 2008. Using ideas
        that had been discussed in the Second Life™
        architecture working group, several users were
        able to teleport their avatars from Linden-owned
        to systems owned by third parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were significant limitations
        however. Avatar appearance was inconsistent
        across regions and cross-grid access to
        inventory was more or less nonexistent. But as a
        first step, it showed that cross-grid
        teleportation were possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interested users can find documentation of the
        Open Grid Protocol (OGP) used by these early
        interop trials on the Second Life™ wiki:

        <li>Teleport <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Later that year we entered a time of economic
        uncertainty. Virtual world interoperability did
        not seem to contribute to the bottom line, and
        there were significant near-term opportunity
        costs. The consensus was we should type up a
        report on our experiences, publish our final OGP
        drafts and focus on less risky things for a few
        months before coming back to it. We were in the
        process of mothballing the interop effort when
        things took an interesting turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside the lab, we knew the UDP-based legacy
        Second Life protocol had some serious
        scalability problems; we wanted to move more
        services to LLSD over HTTP. Most of our work
        serialized LLSD messages as XML documents and
        sent them over the internet. As part of our
        "wrapping up" process, we figured we should
        register the MIME types we used for LLSD. this
        was the motivation for the original "LLSD
        Abstract Type System" <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>
        draft published in early 2009.
      </p>

      <p>
        At around this same time, the Bidirectional HTTP
        (Bi-Di) effort inside the IETF was heating up
        and Mark Lentczner was asked to submit a draft
        and a presentation on "Reverse HTTP"
        <a href="#ref_6">[6]</a> which was based on
        previous work at the lab with Donovan Preston.
      </p>

      <p>
        Originally intended to be small, stand-alone
        drafts with a limited scope, we began the task
        of publishing an informational RFC for the
        purpose of registering the LLSD MIME types.
      </p>

      <p>
        Starting a virtual worlds working group in the
        IETF was not a new idea. The SWMP mailing list
        had been setup in 2007 to discuss the idea. It
        eventually failed to result in a working group
        for reasons that are too complicated to discuss
        here. There was considerable resistance to the
        idea, but around this time, David Lavine at IBM
        started asking "what's next with interop?" David
        and Suzy Deffeyes had invested a fair amount of
        effort in the 2008 interop trail, so it was a
        reasonable question.
      </p>

      <p>
        The more we talked about it, the more it seemed
        like a good idea. In early 2009, Mark Lentczner
        and I lobbied inside the lab for the idea while
        David and Suzy pushed the idea inside IBM. The
        IETF does not officially recognize corporate
        members, people who show up at IETF meetings
        represent themselves. But if a working group was
        ever to be formed, none of us felt comfortable
        pushing the idea without the support of our
        management.
      </p>

      <p>
        We eventually produced an argument for interop
        good enough to garner support inside IBM and
        Linden, so in January of 2009, David Lavine of
        IBM and i approached the IETF informally with a
        proposal to sponsor the work of developing a
        virtual worlds interoperability prototype. At
        the time, we had hoped to develop a protocol
        that would work for a broad range of virtual
        experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        IETF process calls for a "Birds of a Feather" or
        BoF meeting to be held to see if there is
        sufficient interest to justify creation of an
        official working group. On march 24th, 2009 the
        "MMOX BoF" was held at the 74th IETF meeting in
        San Francisco, CA.
      </p>

      <p>
        It did not go as well as we had hoped, but it
        didn't go as bad as we feared it could.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were unable to reach consensus for "broad
        interoperability." we would not be able to, as
        David Lavine once hoped, "meet with your raiding
        party in the sims online, teleport over to world
        of warcraft, slay a dragon and then teleport to
        a pub in Second Life to celebrate."
      </p>

      <p>
        But we did find there were enough people at
        Linden Lab and in the OpenSimulator community
        that were interested in cross-world
        interoperability. The IETF allowed us to
        redefine our scope and hold a second BoF
        session. On july 28th, 2009, the "OGPX BoF" was
        held to discuss the scope of the work (OGPX
        standing for "Open Grid Protocol X".) This
        meeting went well and following some discussion
        on the ogpx@ietf.org mailing list, we were able
        to agree to a group charter.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the IETF, a working group charter defines
        what the group is supposed to be working on and
        what documents it proposes to produce. you can
        view the current charter for the group at the
        IETF's site <a href="#ref_7">[7]</a>. Along
        the way, a number of people objected to the name
        "OGP" or "Open Grid Protocol" as they felt it
        implied the objective of the protocol was to
        manage cloud or grid based systems. Many
        alternate names were proposed including my
        favorites Open Virtual EnviRonments (OVER) and
        Agent BackbOne for Virtual Environments (ABOVE).
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, we settled on the name "VWRAP:
        Virtual Worlds Region Agent Protocol."
      </p>

      <p>
        As an aside, after changing the name from OGPX
        to VWRAP, we forgot to change the name of the
        mailing list until very recently. the current
        mailing list is <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/vwrap">vwrap@ietf.org</a>,
        though there has been significant discussion on <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ogpx">ogpx@ieft.org</a>
        and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/mmox">mmox@ietf.org</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        On march 23rd, 2010, the working group held it's
        first official face to face meeting in Anaheim,
        California. it was a mixed reality event with
        approximately 15-20 people being present in
        incarnate reality and 50 avatars attending in
        the virtual world.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work continues on the vwrap mailing list,
        and anyone with an interest in virtual worlds
        interoperability is encouraged to participate.
