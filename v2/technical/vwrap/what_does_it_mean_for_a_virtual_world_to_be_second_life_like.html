        So the VWRAP working group is off to a good
        start. We've completed the chartering process
        and published a few Internet Drafts. We also had
        a face-to-face meeting a couple weeks ago that
        identified a couple defects in some of our draft
        documents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now it's time to start recruiting people to help
        with the effort. The documents we produce will
        require a number of participants documenting use
        cases, writing documents, creating sample code
        implementations, checking the technical contents
        of draft documents and reviewing the group's
        output to make sure it just plain makes sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        But every time i ask someone to help out, they
        want to read our background documents. And this
        is where i start getting kind of embarrassed; we
        don't have nearly as many as we need. I'm
        writing a series of blog posts about it to give
        an informal and informational introduction to
        VWRAP, the Virtual World Region Agent Protocol.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're new to VWRAP, you may want to read the
        "What is VWRAP" <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>. For
        more detailed info, you may want to read the
        "VWRAP : Introduction and Goals" document.
        <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a> The current draft is 32
        pages and is written to be as precise as
        possible. Because it was written with
        "correctness" in mind, it can be a bit wordy at
        times so my first couple blog posts will be high
        level discussions about what we're trying to
        accomplish.
      </p>

      <p>
        Several people have used the term "Second
        Life-Like" to describe the type of virtual world
        we're hoping to create. But that's a bit of a
        fail; it's bad form to describe something new by
        saying "Hey, it's just like this other thing,
        only a little different." So maybe the first
        question to ask is...
      </p>

      <h2>What Does it Mean to be Second Life-Like ?</h2>

      <p>
        If you've visited Second Life™ as a user and
        then visited World of Warcraft™ or EVE Online™,
        you know they're each pretty different
        experiences. WoW is mostly about fighting. Sure,
        you can be social in some corners of the world,
        but what you're paying for is the ability to
        reign down hurt on other players. EVE Online is
        about dueling spaceships while Second Life is
        about capturing the experience of burning man by
        socializing and building interesting bits of
        art. Or maybe its about business and education;
        we're still trying to figure that one out. But
        it's clearly more open ended than other popular
        massively multi-participant systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        But for software developers and virtual world
        deployers, it's probably a good idea to have a
        better description of the protocol than "Oh,
        it's sorta like Second Life or OpenSim." In the
        "Intro and Goals" document referenced above,
        there are three primary features of VWRAP
        virtual worlds:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>The virtual world exists independently of the participants,</li>
        <li>Avatars have a single, unique presence in a single virtual world, and,</li>
        <li>The virtual world contains persistent objects.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Let's look at these features in more depth:
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Virtual World Exists Independently of the Participants</h2>

      <p>
        Some readers will remember VRML (Virtual Reality
        Markup Language.) It was a text based language
        for describing virtual world scene graphs. There
        was an interactivity model for VRML, so you
        could get objects to do things by interacting
        with the virtual environment. But for the most
        part, tools that used VRML rendered scene graphs
        on local systems and did not interact with
        remote systems or users.
      </p>

      <p>
        So you loaded a virtual experience from local
        storage or from the web, rendered the scene,
        twirled around to look at the objects and could
        optionally interact with this "pocket universe."
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the tools seemed advanced (even for
        today) and you could mock up some relatively
        interesting scenes. But, at the end of the day,
        there were no standards for how to invite other
        participants into your virtual creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is NOT what VWRAP is all about. VWRAP is
        about multiple individuals accessing the same
        scene graph hosted on a public server somewhere
        and everyone sees the same thing when they log
        in. VWRAP worlds are inherently shared
        experiences, not pocket universes on someone's
        desktop system.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
     
      <h2>Avatars Have a Single, Unique Presence in a Single Virtual World</h2>

      <p>
        Like the reified world, the virtual world is a
        social space. The locus of social activity in
        the virtual world is the user's avatar; each
        avatar representing a single user. With due
        respect to even the best "real world"
        multi-taskers, you can still only be in one
        place at a time; so it is with avatars in the
        virtual world.
      </p>

      <p>
        It also means that for every different virtual
        world, there is only one of you. By default, you
        can interact with everyone else in the world and
        they can interact with you.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Virtual World Contains Persistent Objects</h2>

      <p>
        Objects in the virtual world, like virtual
        worlds themselves, persist beyond a user's
        presence in the virtual world. If a user created
        a desk and chairs in a VWRAP virtual world, it
        would continue to exist until explicitly
        deleted. So the user could log in, create an
        object in a particular location in the virtual
        world and then log out. When another user logs
        in and travels to the same location, they would
        see that object.
      </p>

      <p>
        The "Intro and Goals" draft referenced above
        describes these characteristics in more detail,
        but the text here describes the basics of VWRAP
        virtual worlds: there's only one of you, there's
        stuff in the world and the world doesn't
        disappear when you turn your back.
