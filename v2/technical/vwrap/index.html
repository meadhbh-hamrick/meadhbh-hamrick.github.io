    <title>What is VWRAP?</title>

      <p>
        In 2009 and 2010 I was involved in defining and
        implementing the Virtual Worlds Region Agent
        Protocol. I built a number of Node.JS services
        at Linden Lab, helped manage an IETF Working
        Group tasked with shepherding the protocol
        through the standardization process and even
        wrote a bunch of the specs myself. Virtual and
        Augmented reality has boarded the hype-train
        again so I figured it might be interesting to
        re-publish links to the old specs and blog posts
        that have since disappeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        VWRAP was the name of the protocol and the IETF
        Working Group and was focused on supporting
        open, inter-operable, standards-based "Second
        Life-Like" virtual worlds. We weren't trying to
        create a protocol that was "all things to all
        people" and consequently lost a number of good
        potential contributors from Project Wonderland,
        There.Com and elsewhere. (Specifically, Second
        Life uses a model where the "ground truth" is
        owned by the server instead of the truth model
        being distributed among a number of peers.)
      </p>

      <p>
        In an effort to try to explain what VWRAP was
        all about, I penned a number of blog
        posts. Let's start with this one: it's an
        overview of what VWRAP is and how it's intended
        to be used: <a href="what_is_the_virtual_worlds_region_agent_protocol.html">What
        Is the Virtual Worlds Region Agent Protocol</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you're familiar with VWRAP's context, you
        may want to read a few of the specifications. At
        the very least, you should read the
        "Introduction and Goals" Internet Draft written
        my David Levine and myself. The "Abstract Type
        System" Internet Draft introduced the
        description of a hypothetical type system our
        protocol would depend on. It's not horribly
        complicated: integers, booleans, arrays and that
        kind of thing. It might be interesting as a
        model for specifying protocol type behaviour
        without depending on a particular language or
        processor architecture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you've read and digested the Abstract Type
        System documentation, the "Trust Model and User
        Authentication" text can serve as an example of
        how to construct "VWRAP-Like Services" (as well
        as describing the trust model we expected second
        life-like worlds to use.) If the Abstract Type
        System documentation seems too dry, try reading
        the article "<a href="an_abstract_type_system.html">Abstract
        Type System? Hunh?</a>" first. It's short and it
        might help you figure out what's going on with
        that specification.

      <p>
        This is a fair amount of technical documentation
        to consume; and it's all relatively foreign to
        the experience of most web developers. John
        Hurliman and I wrote an internet draft that
        describes how VWRAP / Second Life-Like services
        can be launched via downloading a specially
        formatted message with a particular MIME
        Type. The idea here is that end users' systems
        would be configured to launch a Second Life
        viewer upon receipt of this type of MIME
        message. This would act as a sort of
        authentication bridge between the web world and
        the Second Life virtual world.

        Speaking of VWRAP Internet Drafts, you may want
        to review the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/vwrap/about/">VWRAP
        Working Group Charter</a> and this blog post on
        "<a href="notes_on_the_history_of_the_vwrap_working_group.html">Notes
        on the History of the VWRAP Working Group</a>."
        The history is a little convoluted, having gone
        through the names OGP and MMOX before settling
        on VWRAP.

        The blog post <a href="what_does_it_mean_for_a_virtual_world_to_be_second_life_like.html">What
        Does It Mean for a Virtual World to be
        "Second-Life-Like"</a> describes briefly the
        three features of SL like worlds: the virtual
        world is persistent, things in the virtual world
        are persistent and there's only one of you. A
        more detailed list of things that make a world
        "Second Life-Like" is provided in
        <a href="whats_in_the_protocol.html">What's In
          the  Protocol?</a>
      </p>

        VWRAP makes extensive use of Web
        Capabilities. If you're unfamiliar with this
        term, check out the article on
