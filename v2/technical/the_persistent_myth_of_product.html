    <title>The Persistent Myth of Product</title>

    <section>
      
      <p>
        This morning i had to take it a little easy. I
        burned myself out last night debugging and
        needed a small break. So i spent a little extra
        time sipping my coffee, enjoying my garden and
        reading a random book from my young
        adulthood. The book i picked up from my
        bookshelf was Michael Tomcsyk's "The Home
        Computer Wars." It's a first-hand account of
        Commodore's rise as a home computing juggernaut
        in the early 1980's. Written in an informal,
        first-person style, it's a surprisingly fun
        read; sort of like a romance novel for tech
        geeks.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the things I noticed about the book was
        how few rules there were to making "hit computer
        products" in the early 80's. The market was
        still developing and everyone seemed to have
        their pet theories for how to build the next,
        great thing. The locations involved, Sunnyvale
        and Santa Clara, made me think of the companies
        I worked for in the valley; how their approach
        to structuring a business was straight out of
        the 80's and how that's probably why they're no
        longer around.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm thinking mostly of PalmSource, the software
        spin-off of Palm, Inc. PalmSource was structured
        in a pretty standard way: executive management
        at the top, different divisions for sales,
        marketing, operations and engineering. We worked
        in matrix style teams with product definition
        the responsibility of the team's product
        manager. I don't want to dispiarage anyone on
        the PalmSource team; with very few exceptions
        everyone involved were highly competent
        professionals. But in retrospect, I believe
        PalmSource's organization and rigid
        responsibilities set it up for failure.
      </p>

      <p>
        My team was working on the software to secure
        apps on the device from other, potentially rogue
        apps. I was happy with the work I was doing, but
        the software security work I was doing quickly
        laid bare a sad truth: our product manager had
        no idea why we were including security features.
      </p>

      <p>
        People who have implemented security features on
        products will probably understand how
        frustrating this can be. Security features
        frequently do things like pop up dialogue boxes
        or cause certain types of data accesses to
        fail. As feature developers, we can dial up the
        access protection and annoying interactions or
        we can dial them down. It's not exactly true
        that good user interface and good security are
        mutually exclusive, but it's frequently the case
        (especially in the first rev of a product.)
      </p>

      <p>
        So as developers, we cheat. We have our software
        refer to configuration files to say how
        frequently we should annoy the user and what
        resources we don't let other programs
        access. It's great for the software developer,
        but it's really just kicking the can down the
        road. Someone, somewhere needs to make a
        decision about how often you annoy the user. And
        it's a horrible choice. If you err on the side
        of caution, people hate your user interface. If
        you err on the side of convenience, you open
        yourself up to vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        At PalmSource, we convinced ourselves that our
        product manager would make these decisions or
        would be the conduit for customer
        requirements. But we made a bit of a
        mistake. Our product manager, while very
        competent in the general handheld space, had
        about zero experience with security features and
        not a whole lot of experience evaluating user
        experience. And this was the guy who was going
        to make the decision in the usable vs. secure
        issue.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't blame our product manager. He was a good
        guy put in a situation outside his area of
        expertise. It did take him a little longer to
        recognize this than it should have, but he had a
        lot on his plate. As engineers, we had no way to
        report this issue to upper management because
        our management was actively hostile toward
        security features. (Seriously, my manager once
        fell asleep during a meeting when we were trying
        to explain the problem to him.) We had no
        authority to make a decision on our own, because
        PalmSource's corporate culture was "product
        tells engineering what to build, not the other
        way around."
      </p>

      <p>
        In several old-school companies, the product
        management group is responsible for surveying
        the market, making educated guesses about
        economic trends and customer behaviour and
        developing a target for price and
        performance. Usually (hopefully) guided by the
        executive team's directives on ROI and general
        location in the price / quality matrix, they
        help engineering prioritize features for the
        products under development.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it's increasingly important for product
        managers to have a deep knowledge of the product
        features. In the old days when the division
        between product marketing and engineering was
        established, products were effectively widgets
        with five or ten bullet-point features. The
        "quality" of your product was defined by the
        presence of a bullet-pointed feature or it's
        relative feature. Product managers didn't need
        to know what the features did, only that we had
        one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fast forward to the modern era... The iPhone
        finally got the term "user experience" on the
        lips of executives. Just-In-Time manufacturing
        is the default rather than the exception and
        various SaaS successes have people talking about
        how to provide value through an API. Selling
        software in Sili Valley is less about putting
        bullet points on boxes and more about adapting
        your API to fit into someone else's value chain.
      </p>

      <p>
        So why do we still have product managers that
        aren't also sales engineers? Why did I, as an
        engineer, have to explain the business
        ramifications of poor design choices to our
        product manager? Why did I have to use
        back-channels to find engineers in our
        customer's organizations and ask *them* about
        their business objectives?
      </p>

      <p>
        And I think the answer is "the Persistent Myth
        of Product."
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a truism in marketing that to make money
        you can do two things: figure out what people
        want and make that, or figure out what you're
        good at making and make people want to buy
        it. In the early 80's, the vast majority of the
        populous wasn't familiar with what computers
        could do. It's safe to say people didn't know
        what they wanted. Sure, we all thought we wanted
        a device with more flashy graphics, a better
        keyboard and more memory. But that's just the
        "computer fetishist" view of computing
        products. What we needed to know in the early
        80's was how these devices were going to fit
        into our lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        And while I like to grouse about Apple's
        developer support from time to time, it's hard
        to argue they didn't do an EXCELLENT job
        communicating how Apple products fit into
        people's lives. When the Macintosh came out, IBM
        offered a series of ham-fisted windowing
        programs to counter the Mac's "ease of use"
        argument; ditto for Digital Research; ditto for
        Microsoft. I believe IBM and Microsoft survived
        because they understood the lucrative enterprise
        market.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the early 2000's, Apple struck again with the
        iPod. It wasn't the first personal audio player,
        but it was the first to not treat the user
        interface as a bolt-on afterthought. And Apple
        did another EXCELLENT job communicating how the
        iPod fit in a user's life: buy an iPod, take
        your music with you. By comparison, Diamond and
        Creative were selling Rios and NOMADs like you
        would sell a PC component: by listing bullet
        points on the side of a box.
      </p>

      <p>
        Traditional product managers are taught to
        identify key features of a product segment and
        then communicate those features to an
        engineering team. They are taught that all you
        have to do is make a widget slightly cheaper or
        slightly better and the world will beat a path
        to your door. And in many segments this is true.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it's not true in software. Or at least it's
        not true for organizations that don't want to
        rely on dumb luck.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Product" is not defined by a market, but by
        observing people, figuring out how technology
        can affect their lives, building it and
        communicating that change to the end user. Don't
        depend on an existing market to tell you what to
        build. Depend on your customer's need
        first. Or... figure out what you're good at
        building and figure out how it fits into your
        customer's life.
