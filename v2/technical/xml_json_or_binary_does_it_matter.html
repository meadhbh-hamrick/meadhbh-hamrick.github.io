    <title>XML, JSON or Binary : Does It Matter?</title>

    <a name="00_Intro"></a>
    <section id="00_Intro">
      
      <p>
        Of course it matters. But with a tiny amount of
        effort, it doesn't have to matter much.
      </p>

      <p>
        This document describes a way of thinking about
        structured data and it's use in distributed
        applications. When implementing web-based APIs,
        developers traditionally use a well-supported
        message format such as JSON or XML. In
        applications where there is a perceived need for
        processing speed, custom binary formats are
        sometimes utilized. Each format has it's own
        benefits and drawbacks and this document will
        not argue their relative merits. It will,
        however, recommend an approach which abstracts
        away details of the specific message format
        (XML, JSON, binary) and focuses the application
        developer on more important aspects of
        application design.
      </p>

      <p>
        We start by examining the benefits and
        limitations of each message format, then
        describe an XML DTD and sample tagged binary
        format which can be mechanically converted into
        other described formats. We then describe how
        these formats can be used with HTTP(S) and
        conclude with a simple software architecture
        that allows HTTP(S) clients to specify their
        message format preference.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, we conclude that if you use the XML
        DTD described in this document, it is easy to
        mechanically convert between formats. Because
        HTTP(S) allows clients to specify their
        preferred message format for responses with the
        Accept: header, it truly doesn't matter which is
        used: XML, JSON or binary.

      <h2>Why Use XML?</h2>

      <p>
        XML is a well-respected and well-understood
        specification for communicating structured
        data. It's parsing rules are unambiguous and a
        large ecosystem of tools has emerged to support
        applications that use it.
      </p>

      <p>
        XML does come with drawbacks, however. The most
        notable "problem" with XML is that it is not
        self-describing at the semantic level. The 'X'
        in XML stands for 'eXtensible' and this
        flexibility comes with a cost: you must use a
        schema (or DTD) to describe the relationship of
        elements within an XML document so applications
        consuming it can validate the document.
      </p>

      <p>
        XML Schemas (XSD, etc.) and Document Type
        Definitions (DTDs) work reasonably well in
        tightly-coupled applications where the document
        producer and consumer can easily agree on the
        document's schema. But in loosely coupled
        application environments, it is difficult (or
        impossible) for a document producer to know what
        specific schema a consumer is expecting.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a difficult problem for most
        applications targeting browsers. Web
        applications are typically delivered as
        JavaScript programs, downloaded each time the
        end user visit's the application's URL. Because
        the client-side JavaScript application is
        downloaded from the server, the server's
        operator can ensure the server-side application
        components use the same schema for messages
        between the client and server.
      </p>

      <p>
        But for non-browser targeted APIs exposed
        through HTTP(S), version skew between server and
        client remains an issue.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users of XML can choose to use a less-strict
        standard for XML documents; application
        developers can specify that documents be "well
        formed" instead of "valid." This relieves
        developers of the responsibility of ensuring
        client and server agree on a specific schema,
        but also obviates many of XML's benefits.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Not Use JSON?</h2>

      <p>
        JSON (originally JavaScript Object Notation) was
        intended as a light-weight format for
        communicating structured data. Parsing JSON is
        notably easier than XML and includes "built-in"
        type semantics. Even though JSON specifically
        uses JavaScript's type semantics, users of other
        languages (PHP, C#, Java, etc.) have found it
        easy enough to use. It turns out that a 31 bit
        integer is a 31 bit integer regardless of what
        programming language you use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Proponents of JSON point to its "schema-less"
        notation as a benefit over XML in loosely
        coupled systems. XML adherents note that JSON's
        relative paucity of types obviates rich
        representation of semantic intent. But for
        application developers building loosely coupled
        systems, you're probably only requiring
        documents to be "well formed" instead of
        "valid," so you've probably already lost much of
        XML's expressive capability.
      </p>

      <p>
        JSON is also "self-describing" -- you don't need
        additional information to convert a JSON
        document into a JavaScript object (or a C data
        structure or a Java map or ...)
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>And Here's An Important Point</h2>

      <p>
        In loosely coupled systems, the consumer of a
        message may need to accept a later version of a
        message and attempt to reason about it. JSON's
        schema-less / self-describing nature allows the
        "message parsing layer" to defer reasoning about
        semantic intent to the application layer. You
        can do the same thing with XML, but only if you
        use a DTD that won't change between message
        versions.
      </p>

      <p>
        This "N+1 Ability" is crucial to deploying
        systems that do not break when version skew is
        introduced.
      </p>

      <p>
        Specifically, if a validating XML parser
        encounters a "version N+1 message" that uses a
        element unknown to it's own "version N" schema,
        it will stop parsing and raise an
        exception. This is probably the correct
        behaviour in a tightly-coupled system where
        message producers and consumers are in close
        agreement. But it is almost never the correct
        behaviour for loosely coupled systems where
        participants may not coordinate which version of
        a schema is being used.
      </p>

      <h2>Making XML "Self-Describing"</h2>

      <p>
        As mentioned above, it is difficult to use XML's
        full capabilities in a loosely-coupled
        system. But you can certainly use a subset of
        XML features and retain several of it's
        benefits. To make XML suitable for
        loosely-coupled systems, you should either:
      </p>

      <ul>
        
        <li>
          Relax the requirements for XML documents to be
          "valid" and instead require them to be
          "well-formed."
        </li>

        <li>
          Or, use a DTD such as Apple's P-List or VWRAP
          LLSD/XML whose DTDs describe the type of
          elements and not it's semantic intent.
        </li>
        
      </ul>

      <p>
        An example message using VWRAP XML serialization
        follows:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
   &lt;llsd&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
     &lt;integer&gt;42&lt;/integer&gt;
     &lt;uuid&gt;6bad258e-06f0-4a87-a659-493117c9c162&lt;/uuid&gt;
     &lt;map&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;hot&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;cold&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;higgs_boson_rest_mass&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;undef/&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;info_page&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;uri&gt;https://example.org/6bad258e-06f0&lt;/uri&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;status_report_due_by&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;date&gt;2008-10-13T19:00.00Z&lt;/date&gt;
     &lt;/map&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
   &lt;/llsd&gt;</pre>

      <p>
        Key take-aways from this example include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        
        <li>
          XML tags describe the type of the data they
          enclose.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          The structure of the document is preserved.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          XML tags do not describe semantic
          intent. Instead, semantic intent is assumed
          based on position in an array or by the
          key-value preceeding the data tag.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Another useful characteristic of P-Lists or
        VWRAP LLSD documents is they can be
        automatically converted into JSON. Here is the
        same example document serialized as a JSON
        message:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

[
  42,
  "6bad258e-06f0-4a87-a659-493117c9c162",
  {
    "hot": "cold",
    "higgs_boson_rest_mass": null,
    "info_page": "https://example.org/6bad258e-06f0",
    "status_report_due_by": "2008-10-13T19:00.00Z"
  }
]</pre>

      <p>
        Careful examination will reveal that it is easy
        to convert the first format into the
        second. Converting the second into the first is
        slightly more difficult. In the VWRAP
        environment, this problem was solved using an
        abstract type system and interface description
        language which is outside the scope of this
        document. A simple solution would be to mirror
        JSON types in an XML DTD like this:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  &lt;!ELEMENT dsd (undef|boolean|number|string|array|map)*&gt;
  &lt;!ELEMENT undef EMPTY&gt;
  &lt;!ELEMENT boolean (#PCDATA)&gt;
  &lt;!ELEMENT number (#PCDATA)&gt;
  &lt;!ELEMENT string (#PCDATA)&gt;
  &lt;!ELEMENT array (undef|boolean|number|string|array|map)*&gt;
  &lt;!ELEMENT map (key,(undef|boolean|number|string|array|map))*&gt;
  &lt;!ELEMENT key (#PCDATA)&gt;
  &lt;!ATTLIST string xml:space (default|preserve) 'preserve'&gt;</pre>

      <p>
        This DTD has the advantage that it specifies XML
        documents which can be mechanically converted
        into JSON and back again with no loss of
        expressibility. The disadvantage is that it uses
        none of XML's capacity to carry semantic intent.
      </p>

      <h2>Should a Message Parser Care About Semantic Intent?</h2>
      
      <p>
        And this is the crux of the matter. Should a
        message parser care about the richness of
        semantic intent (like XML seems to do?) or
        should it defer to the application layer logic
        to worry about the meaning of elements in a
        protocol message?
      </p>

      <p>
        The authors of this paper believe that message
        parsers in loosely coupled systems, the part of
        an application which deserializes protocol
        messages into internal formats used directly by
        application software, should not attempt to
        interpret the semantic intent of protocol
        messages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tightly coupled systems, on the other hand, may
        find it easier to use messaging systems which
        throw exceptions when they receive semantically
        nonsensical messages. In environments where one
        organization controls the producer and consumer
        of a message, it is much easier to dictate which
        protocol versions are used. The situation is
        akin to the assert() function in
        C-programming. Using it will cause a program to
        exit; but if you really don't know what to do
        with malformed input from a user, this may be
        the best alternative.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your messaging middleware sends an exception
        when it receives a message whose semantics it
        can't understand, that eliminates the
        application layer from reasoning about the
        intent of the message. Depending on your
        application, that may be the best course of
        action.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What About Binary Message Formats?</h2>

      <p>
        We mentioned binary formats in the sections
        above. When should they be used? The authors of
        this document believe the answer is "more or
        less never." However, we concede there are
        situations where binary protocol data units are
        justified. But in modern systems, the time
        required to parse a message from a
        human-readable text format into a
        machine-readable binary format is
        inconsequential for all but the most extreme
        cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        Human readable text formats offer significant
        benefits for debugging.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you feel you must use a binary format, please
        consider using a self-describing binary format
        so debugging probes can deconstruct protocol
        messages without resorting to an external
        dictionary. An example of such a system can be
        found in the Binary Serialization section of the
        VWRAP Abstract Type System draft referenced at
        the end of this document.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do use a binary format, it is important
        to think about why. Two primary reasons are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        
        <li>
          Eliminate serialization and de-serialization
          overhead when processing messages
        </li>

        <li>
          Reduce the size of protocol messages
        </li>
        
      </ul>

      <p>
        Both are laudable goals, but with modern systems
        and networks, may be pre-mature
        optimizations. Serializing and deserializing
        JSON is less compute-intensive than ASN.1/BER or
        XML parsing. In loosely coupled systems, you
        can't assume you know details of the computer
        architecture of the system receiving a
        message. Senders cannot simply copy an in-memory
        data structure into a message and assume the
        receiver will be able to efficiently consume
        it. Endianness, word size and memory alignment
        restrictions may make it difficult for a
        receiving system to simply copy a data structure
        from a protocol message into working memory and
        use it directly. There are also significant
        security issues with this approach. Fortunately,
        there are few developers who would approve of
        such a system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Common binary formats such as MessagePack,
        ProtoBufs, Avro and Thrift TBinaryProtocol avoid
        serious security and interoperability issues,
        but at the cost of processing time. All binary
        formats have the disadvantage that they are
        often harder to reason about when debugging;
        which is easier for a human to comprehend, a
        JSON or XML message or a compressed binary?
      </p>

      <p>
        But there will always be situations where binary
        message serialization should be considered, so
        the advice given in this paper is: in loosely
        coupled systems, use binary serialization
        formats that are self-describing (i.e. - that do
        not require an external resource to decode the
        sender's semantic intent.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The authors of this paper also suggest you use a
        binary format that can be mechanically
        translated into JSON or XML.

      <h2>On the Advantages of HTTP(S)</h2>

      <p>
        HTTP has been an overwhelming success over the
        previous twenty-five years. Other protocols
        (such as BEEP, IIOP, AMQP or XMPP) certainly
        have advantages over HTTP for specific use
        cases, but HTTP's simplicity and the ubiquity of
        tools which relieve the application developer
        from "boring" housekeeping tasks make it "first
        among equals" for network applications. In
        short, if you are building a distributed
        application, consider using HTTP first and then
        revert to some other mechanism when you find
        HTTP does not meet your needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few of HTTP's advantages:
      </p>

      <ul>
        
        <li>
          <strong>Ubiquity</strong>: It is hard to find
          a piece of network equipment that does not
          understand HTTP.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <strong>Text Based</strong>: It is *much*
          easier to decode the header of a HTTP message
          than an IIOP message.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <strong>Caching</strong>: For applications
          that would benefit from content caching, HTTP
          has well-defined semantics for caching
          information.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <strong>Proxying</strong>: HTTP has
          well-defined semantics for proxying requests
          through proxies and application firewalls.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <strong>Flexibility</strong>: With
          <code>Accept:</code> and
          <code>Content-Type:</code> headers, you can
          tunnel just about anything over HTTP.
        </li>
        
      </ul>

      <p>
        HTTP messages are most commonly carried over
        TCP/IP, but it is also possible to use HTTP with
        any reasonable transport, including: UNIX domain
        sockets, FIFO / Pipes, and serial links. Any
        transport that supports error free,
        bi-directional communication can (in theory) be
        used.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Using HTTP Content Negotiation (i.e. - Accept: Headers)</h2>

      <p>
        The HTTP specification describes several headers
        which enable "Content Negotiation." For our
        purpose, we only consider the
        <code>Accept:</code> and
        <code>Content-Type:</code> headers. If we limit
        responses to API requests to formats which can
        be mechanically converted between each other, it
        doesn't matter which format is used since the
        client can consume the message directly or
        convert it into a format it can consume. If the
        client does have a preference, it can
        communicate this preference by adding an
        <code>Accept:</code> header to the request.
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>Accept:</code> headers include a list of
        acceptable media types a client is willing to
        consume. According to the HTTP specifications,
        the server picks a specific media type for the
        response and communicates its choice to the
        client using the <code>Content-Type:</code>
        header.
      </p>

      <p>
        For our purposes, if the client did not have a
        preference (JSON, XML or Binary) it could omit
        the <code>Accept:</code> header. If it did, it
        would include a header listing the acceptable
        format. For example:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   Accept: application/dsd+json</pre>

      <p>
        In response, the server should always specify
        the serialization format used with the
        <code>Content-Type:</code> header, like so:

        The authors have used the following media types
        to describe the specific transfer syntax used in
        HTTP messages:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  application/dsd+text    - "Dynamic Structured Data (DSD)" text format
  application/dsd+json    - JSON
  application/dsd+xml     - XML using the DSD DTD (described above)
  application/dsd+binary  - A binary format related to the DSD text format</pre>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        This document has tried to demonstrate it is
        possible to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        
        <li>
          Mechanically convert structured data between
          JSON, XML and Binary formats
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Communicate with HTTP(S) clients using a
          message serialization of the client's choice
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The benefits for loosely coupled systems
        include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          No code change required when a new client
          wants to use a new serialization format
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Moves reasoning of semantic intent of message
          elements into the application layer
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Provides (some) defense against the "version
          N+1 message producer" problem
        </li>
        
      </ul>

      <p>
        It does come with some costs, including:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>
          The richness of XML expressability is largely
          lost
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Self describing message formats are often
          larger than comparable non-self-describing
          formats.
        </li>
        
      </ul>

      <p>
        It is the experience of the authors, however,
        that for loosely coupled systems, the benefits
        of the "transfer syntax neutral" approach
        described here outweigh the costs and encourage
        system developers to consider using it.
