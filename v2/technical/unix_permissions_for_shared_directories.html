    <title>Unix Permissions for Shared Directories</title>

    <section>
      <p>
        Do you work on a shared system where you are one
        of several people who needs to edit content in a
        shared directory? Or maybe you work on a Linux
        system where the static web content is in a
        shared directory owned by a system users (who's
        not you.) This latter case is the default for
        Apache or Lighttpd on Ubuntu. You may have
        encountered permissions problems when trying to
        edit files in these directories. This page
        describes a simple technique for changing
        permissions of a shared directories so a list of
        authorized users can edit its contents. As
        security boffins will tell you, this is
        preferred to making the directory "world
        writable" -- the last thing you need is a random
        internet troll defacing your web site.

      <h2>What Are You Trying To Tell Me?</h2>

      <p>
        Simply put, there's an easy, safer way to make a
        directory (and its sub-directories) writable by
        a subset of system users.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Why Is This Useful?</h2>

      <p>
        While you should have a system in place to store
        your content in a version control system and
        then deploy that content to a real server
        somewhere on the internet, sometimes the world
        doesn't work that way. For instance, I sometimes
        want to test the behaviour of a browser locally
        on my Linux laptop or in a Linux virtual
        machine. I don't want to check a file into
        version control after every minor change and
        wait for it to be deployed. In this case I want
        to edit files directly in the web server's
        static content directory hierarchy.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the default configuration for Ubuntu and
        Debian is to not allow this.
      </p>

      <p>
        The steps below describe how to fix this.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you follow these steps, you won't have to
        <code>sudo</code> to root to edit a file. Any
        tool you happen to use to create web-pages,
        whether it's a WYSIWYG tool like FirstPage or a
        text editor like Emacs, it should just work.
      </p>

      <h2>Details, Please.</h2>

      <p>
        Unix, Linux, Darwin, BSD -- all modern Unixes --
        only allow you to write a new file to a
        directory if:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>You are the owner of the directory and the
        directory has the "user write" bit set</li>
        <li>You are a member of a group that owns that
        directory and the directory has the "group
        write" bit set</li>
        <li>If all else fails, if the directory has the
        "write other" bit set, anyone can create a file
        in the directory.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It's generally considered a bad idea to let
        anyone write content to a particular directory,
        so we should probably forget about that last
        item.
      </p>

      <p>
        And we're not really interested in the first
        case because we're explicitly talking about
        <em><strong>shared</strong></em> directories;
        directories where multiple people can read and
        write files.
      </p>

      <p>
        That leaves us with item number two: group
        ownership of files.
      </p>

      <p>
        Debian (and it's commercial derivative Ubuntu)
        come pre-configured with a group called
        <code>www-data</code>. By default, new users
        aren't added to this group. When you install a
        web server like Apache or Lighttpd, you can
        change the group owner of it's static content
        directory to allow group writes. Then you just
        add yourself to www-data group, and change the
        group permissions on the shared directory and
        viola! you can write to the shared directory!
      </p>

      <p>
        This example assumes your static web content is
        in the directory <code>/var/www/html</code>,
        which is where you find it on recent Ubuntu
        systems.
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   $ <strong>sudo addgroup `whoami` www-data</strong>
   $ <strong>sudo chgrp -R www-data /var/www/html</strong>
   $ <strong>sudo find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;</strong>
   $ <strong>sudo find /var/www/html -type f -exec chmod 0775 {} \;</strong></pre>

      <p>
        Except it's not exactly that easy. Because of
        the way group permissions work in Linux, you
        have to log out and log back in. You could type
        the command <code>su - `whoami`</code> to test
        that it works, but that will give you a
        sub-shell that doesn't have the DISPLAY
        environment variable set, which could be a
        problem if you're using an X/Windows based
        editor.
      </p>

      <p>
        After relogging-in, you can test that it works
        with the following commands:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  $ <strong>touch /var/www/html/foo</strong>
  $ <strong>ls -ld /var/www/html</strong>
  drwxrwsr-x 2 root www-data 4096 Mar 26 13:06 /var/www/html/
  $ <strong>ls -l /var/www/html/foo</strong>
  -rw-rw-r-- 1 you www-data 0 Mar 26 13:06 /var/www/html/foo</pre>

        <p>
          If you don't see <code>-rw-rw-r--</code> in
          the last line of output above (specifically,
          if you see <code>-rw-r--r--</code> ) make sure
          you're not issuing the touch command as the
          root user. Debian is supposed to default to a
          0002 umask for normal users and 0022 for
          root. But you may need to manually change the
          file mode creation mask (umask) to 0002, like
          this:
        </p>

        <pre class="code">

   $ <strong>umask 022</strong></pre>

        <p>
          The default umask used to be set in
          <code>~/.profile</code> or
          <code>/etc/profile</code> and was easy to
          change. Unfortunately, there are a number of
          different places where the default umask is
          now set in Ubuntu, so your mileage may vary,
          but the command above will always work when
          issued from the command line.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you set this up, anyone in the
          <code>www-data</code> group will have
          permission to read, write and delete files in
          the shared directory, even if that directory
          is owned by the root user.
        </p>

      <h2>So What's Going On Here?</h2>
      
      <p>
        The real magic here is when we recursively set
        the SetGID bit on the shared directory and it's
        sub-directories. This is what the <code>sudo find
        /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;</code>
        command did. The SetGID bit tells the system to
        inherit the group owner of new files from the
        group owner of the directory it's created in. By
        setting the Write and SetGID bits, authorized
        users can edit files in this directory and
        permission to edit these files are automagically
        given to other members of the www-data group.
      </p>

      <p>
        But remember, it's probably bad practice to log
        into web servers and edit files on the
        fly. Sure, sometimes you may have to do this in
        an emergency, but your process should involve
        storing changes in a version control system,
        having team-mates review the changes, and then
        have the changes deployed to your production
        systems with a continuous deployment system. The
        process described here should work fine on a
        development machine, however.
