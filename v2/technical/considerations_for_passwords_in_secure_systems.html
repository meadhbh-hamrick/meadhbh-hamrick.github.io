      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        There is no other system security component more
        ubiquitous than the simple password. The use of
        passwords on multi-user systems is so common
        today that it's difficult to remember there was
        a time when users did not use passwords to log
        onto a personal computer. The most common use of
        passwords is to authenticate a user to a system,
        but there are other uses for passwords. This
        document provides guidance to software
        developers as to how to properly implement
        systems that use or hold passwords. We begin
        with simple introduction to the concept of
        Password Based Encryption. Password Based
        Encryption (or PBE for short,) is a family of
        techniques which derive a pseudo-random string
        of bits appropriate for use as an encryption
        key. At first glance, this may seem to be a
        simple task. As we shall see, however, it is a
        little more difficult.

      <h2>A Little History of Password Usage</h2>

      <p>
        Passwords are traditionally used to authenticate
        users to systems or networks. The Unix
        /etc/passwd file, the Windows SAM database, and
        the Apache htpasswd utility are all examples of
        system components designed to securely store
        user authenticators. An examination of each of
        these systems finds that none of them actually
        store passwords. Instead, a hashed or encrypted
        version of the password (or pass phrase) is
        stored. To understand why may require a little
        history lesson.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the original multi-user computer systems
        stored 'plaintext' passwords. This is to say, if
        your password was 'g78twin2', then the system
        stored 'g78twin2' in a database somewhere. There
        were some worries that someone might get access
        to this master database, but for the most
        computer security managers were confident in the
        file and database security features included in
        these old systems. People discussed improvements
        to the system, but without a compelling reason
        to ratchet up the security of password storage
        sub-systems, most everyone thought there were
        more important things to work on.

      <h2>The TENEX Password Bug</h2>

      <p>
        All this changed in the early 70's with a clever
        exploit of a vulnerability in the TENEX
        operating system. TENEX was a popular operating
        system for the PDP 10 system. For the time it
        was an advanced system with many innovative
        features. In the early 70's one of the more
        interesting features in computer system
        architecture was virtual memory. Virtual memory,
        for those unfamiliar with the term, refers to
        the use of special hardware to transparently
        swap data from memory to the hard drive when it
        hasn't been used in a while. This helps the
        system run more large, complex programs
        simultaneously. If one program hasn't accessed
        some of it's data in a while, it is written to
        disk and the memory is reallocated to a program
        with an urgent need for more memory. When a
        chunk of memory (called a "page") is written to
        disk, it is said that that page has been "paged
        out." When a program needs that memory again,
        the program is halted while the "paged out" data
        is read back into memory. This event is called a
        "page fault."
      </p>

      <p>
        A group of clever hackers noticed that they
        could figure out if a page fault had occurred by
        keeping a close eye on the system clock. Hard
        disks of the day were expensive and slow. From
        the computer processor's perspective, it took an
        relatively long time to read data back from
        disk. A function that would take 200
        microseconds to complete in memory could take as
        long as 200 milliseconds (that's 2 tenths of a
        second) to complete if there was a page fault in
        the middle of the function. Using the ability to
        accurately measure the time the system takes to
        check a password, these clever attackers were
        able to guess passwords with remarkable
        accuracy. Here's how they did it.
      </p>

      <p>
        To check a password, the system compared each
        character in the stored password with the one
        provided by the user. If any of the character's
        didn't match, an error would be returned. The
        pseudo code might have looked something like
        this:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   int i;
   for( i=0; i<8; i++ ) {
     if( stored_password[i] != trial_password[i] )
       break;
   }
   if( i < 8 )
     return( ERROR );</pre>

      <p>
        This code simply says when comparing a trial
        password with a stored password, check all eight
        characters in the password, if one of the
        characters in the trial password given by the
        user does not match the character in the stored
        password, break out of the loop. After the loop
        check to see if all eight characters were
        checked; if not, report an error. (Don't try to
        compile this code, it's meant to be a
        pseudo-code example...) If all eight characters
        were checked and none reported an error, then
        the trial password given by the user and the
        password stored in the system password database
        are the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        A cursory examination of this code would imply
        that if an attacker was guessing passwords, they
        would have to try every valid password; checking
        all 2^64 possibilities. To avoid having to check
        so many passwords, the attackers devised a
        cunning plan. They placed their candidate
        password on a page boundary. This is where two
        chunks of memory join; by carefully crafting an
        attack program, the attackers put only the first
        part of a trial password on the first memory
        page. The remainder of the password was placed
        on the second memory page and then "swapped out
        to disk." They then asked the system to check
        their trial password, and measured how long it
        took.
      </p>

      <p>
        What's the point of this exercise? If the first
        character they guessed was incorrect, the system
        would fail after reading only the first
        character in the first page. The password
        subsystem would not need to check characters two
        through eight and would not load the second page
        in from disk. Remember, the attackers found a
        way to accurately measure the time it took the
        system to check their 'trial' password. If the
        system did not generate a page fault while
        reading their trial password, then the first
        character in their guess was incorrect. They
        simply repeated this process until a page fault
        indicated they had found the right character in
        the first position of the password.
      </p>

      <p>
        This technique also works for the remaining
        seven characters in the password. By storing
        different parts of the trial password on
        different pages, the TENEX hackers were able to
        guess the entire password in considerably fewer
        trials than the 2^64 guesses it should have
        taken. By applying this "timing attack" against
        trial passwords, first with the first character
        on the first memory page, then with two
        characters on the first page, and so on, the
        attackers created an attack with a 2^8 * 8 (or
        2^11) worst case. Due to the birthday paradox,
        on average, they should be able to recover a
        password with 2^7 * 8 (or 2^10) guesses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Modern password systems avoid timing attacks
        such as the one described here by hashing and
        salting, techniques described in the "Avoiding
        the Dictionary Attack" section below.

      <h2>Problems With Passwords in Smart Cards</h2>

      <p>
        Some readers may be familiar with Smart Cards;
        they look like credit cards with electrical
        contacts in the upper left portion of the front
        face. Within the security industry, they're a
        well known technology and have been around for
        ages. Most modern cards contain a cryptographic
        coprocessor and secure storage for cryptographic
        keys. They're used extensively to provide mobile
        storage for secret or private keys. While there
        are noticeable barriers to widespread adoption,
        Smart Cards are great at what they do: securely
        move keys from one machine to the next.
      </p>

      <p>
        When using a Smart Card, it is common practice
        to require the card's owner to log in with a
        password or PIN code. In the early days of Smart
        Card usage, the password used to authenticate a
        user to the smart card was stored in the clear
        in the smart card. In the next section, we'll
        talk about why this is a bad idea for multi-user
        systems, but Smart Cards were considered to be
        secure, single user systems. Furthermore, once a
        password was set, there was no protocol
        interface to get the password back out. Many
        developers thought this was sufficient to secure
        the password stored in the card. For many years,
        it was.
      </p>

      <p>
        All this changed when some clever researchers
        pointed out that if you steal someone's smart
        card, give it a fake password, and take very
        accurate readings of the card's current and
        voltage use, you can mount an attack similar to
        the TENEX password attack. In the case of Smart
        Cards however, you don't necessarily perform a
        timing test, but a power usage test. Two types
        of "power attacks" work because the hardware
        inside the smart card uses a slightly different
        amount of power based on what instruction is
        being executed and the number of bits set in a
        particular register.
      </p>

      <p>
        The assembly language instructions executed
        inside the smart card to check a password given
        to it might look something like this:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

       xor cx, cx      ; Clear the CX register
   top_of_loop:
       cmp cx, 8       ; Have we looked at all 8 characters?
       je are_equal    ; If so, and we haven't found an error, then the password is correct
       mov ah, [ds:si] ; Move the Nth character of the stored password to register AH
       cmp ah, [es:di] ; Compare it with the Nth character of the trial password
       jne not_equal   ; If the two are not equal, exit the loop
       inc cx          ; Increment the password length counter, and pointers
       inc si          ; to stored and trial passwords
       inc di
       jmp top_of_loop ; jump to the top of the loop and check the next character
   not_equal:
       mov ah, FFh     ; put a -1 in the AH register
       jmp exuent_omnis
   are_equal:
       xor ah, ah      ; clear the AH register
   exuent_omnis:
       ret             ; return to the calling function</pre>

      <p>
        This code assumes that both passwords are 8
        characters long, and will return a 0 in the AH
        register if the passwords are equal and a -1 in
        AH if the two are not equal. We further assume
        that the register pair DS:SI points to the
        password stored in the smart card, while the
        ES:DI register pair points to the password
        provided by the user.
      </p>

      <p>
        By tracing the execution of this code, you can
        see that as soon as a bad character is found, we
        escape out of the password checking loop. Were
        we monitoring the power usage of the smart card
        as this password checking code was being run, we
        would see a different power signature for a loop
        that failed after checking one character than
        for a loop that checked all eight characters (or
        any other number of characters.) Because we
        could see how many characters we got right, we
        could attack the password checking code inside
        the smart card in the same way that TENEX based
        passwords were attacked.
      </p>

      <p>
        The solution to this problem is usually
        considered to be hashing as described in the
        next section, "Passwords In the Clear." Certain
        classes of smart cards don't have the processing
        power to rapidly calculate the cryptographic
        hash for this scheme to be effective. In
        situations like this, it is sometimes considered
        acceptable to still store the password in the
        clear, but check it with a slightly different
        loop. The following code is considered more
        secure than the code above. Why? It avoids
        generating a power signature by executing
        exactly the same code, irrespective of whether
        the stored password matches the trial password.
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

       xor cx, cx      ; clear the cx and al registers
       xor al, al
   top_of_loop:
       mov ah, [ds:si] ; XOR the Nth character of the stored and trial
       xor ah, [es:di] ; password together, putting the result in the AH register
       or al, ah       ; OR the contents of the AH and AL registers, putting the result
                       ; in the AL register
       inc cx
       cmp cx, 8
       jne top_of_loop
   bottom_of_loop:
       mov ah, al
       ret</pre>

      <p>
        This code effectively does the same thing. If
        the two passwords are identical, then when the
        Nth character of the given password is XORed
        with the Nth character of the trial password,
        the result will be zero. After XORing each of
        the characters in the two passwords together, we
        use a logical OR to combine the results. If two
        passwords are the same, the result will be
        zero. If the two are not the same, then the
        result will be non-zero.
      </p>

      <p>
        This code should come with a caveat,
        however. Storing passwords "in the clear," is an
        inherently dangerous thing to do. If there is a
        flaw in the password handling code within the
        smart card, there is an outside possibility that
        it might be exploitable. There is also the
        possibility that an attacker could place an
        extremely sensitive power meter up to the smart
        card an try to measure the current drawn by the
        AL register. There is some data to indicate that
        this is not so far-fetched of an idea. Modern
        smart card systems take precautions to avoid
        this possibility, but there's no guarantee that
        today's safeguards won't be defeated by
        tomorrow's exploits.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are developing a smart card solution, and
        you feel you should use this approach, be
        prepared for the possibility of an exploit.
      </p>

      <p>
        No matter how tempted you are, do not use this
        approach in a multi-user operating system.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Securing the Password File</h2>

      <p>
        Another problem with passwords is storing them
        securely. From reading about the TENEX bug, we
        already have the idea that storing passwords "in
        the clear" is a bad idea. There is another
        reason why cleartext passwords are a bad idea:
        password databases are a single point of failure
        for a security system. Imagine what would happen
        if an attacker was able to recover the password
        for every user on a system. The attacker could
        log in as any user, modify any file, and
        effectively steal any user's identity. Want to
        write an angry letter to your boss? Want to
        commit credit card fraud or try to hack into
        someone elses computer? You wouldn't do these
        things from your account, and neither would an
        attacker. One of the first places an attacker
        will go when a system is compromised is the user
        password database. If the attacker can assume
        someone else's identity, he or she can operate
        with fear of reprisal or capture.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's clearly a good idea to protect access to
        the password database. But at the same time, the
        password database has to be accessible to
        authenticate users when they want to log in. In
        order to authenticate a user, some portion of
        the system must access the password database to
        check the authenticity of passwords given by
        users as they log in. Computer systems are good
        at granting full access or completely
        restricting access. It is an unfortunate truth
        that bugs in the software that manages access to
        the password database can be used by attackers
        to gain illicit access to it's contents.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is also the problem of password database
        backups. If a user's password is stored in a
        database and that database is backed up, a
        clever attacker could attempt to steal the
        backup tape. Stealing the backup tape would work
        even if there is a great deal of security
        surrounding the computer system being attacked.
      </p>

      <p>
        In response to these issues, it has become a
        common practice to hash passwords before storing
        them in a password database.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>An Example of Using a Hashed Password System</h2>

      <p>
        At this point we've talked a little about why
        passwords should be hashed (or encrypted) prior
        to storing in the password database. Now we will
        talk about how passwords are hashed. We assume
        that readers are familiar with hash functions,
        but if not, here is a brief introduction. Hash
        functions are used to convert a string of
        arbitrarily length into a fixed bit string. The
        data to be hashed is called the 'pre-image,'
        while the output of a hash function is called
        the 'hash' or 'digest.' Hash functions have many
        uses, but one of the most popular uses is to
        ease the comparison of two strings. Rather than
        comparing two strings directly, a developer can
        compare the hash of the two strings. This is
        advantageous as it allows software developers to
        optimize comparison techniques and to have a
        representation of the arbitrarily long string in
        a fixed length buffer. There is a class of hash
        functions called "cryptographic hash functions"
        or "message digest codes" that have a few more
        properties. The most interesting is the
        computational difficulty of finding a pre-image
        for a given hash. For the rest of this document,
        assume we're talking about cryptographic hash
        functions when we mention hash functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Systems that store password hashes effectively
        all do the same thing:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>When a user creates his or her password, the password is hashed and the hash is stored in the password database</li>
        <li>When a user attempts to login, the password entered at the login terminal (the trial password) is hashed</li>
        <li>The hash of the trial password is compared with the password stored in the password database</li>
        <li>If the two hashes are identical, we assume the user entered the correct password.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Lets try an example. Assume that my user name is
        'mhamrick' and my password is 'dingo.' When I
        establish an account on a system I am asked for
        my initial password. I dutifully enter 'dingo'
        when prompted. Instead of storing 'dingo' in the
        password database next to my username
        'mhamrick', the system stores the MD5 hash of
        'dingo' which in hexadecimal is: f5 c2 26 e5 04
        4e 5d f0 5c e4 9e 9e b0 bc ac 1c. When I come
        back to log in, I enter my username and password
        at the login prompt. The system uses my username
        as a key in the database to look up my
        password. Assuming everything works correctly,
        the login program retrieves 'f5 c2 26 e5 04 4e
        5d f0 5c e4 9e 9e b0 bc ac 1c' from the
        database. If I entered my password correctly, it
        should hash to the same thing. The system
        compares the two hashes, finds them identical,
        and logs me in as user 'mhamrick.'
      </p>

      <p>
        So, what happens if I enter the password in
        wrong. Lets first say that I transposed a few
        letters in the password as I was entering it
        in. Instead of entering 'dingo,' I entered
        'dnigo.' The resultant hash of 'dnigo' is: f6 dc
        32 60 da ac b2 61 ed 22 cd 32 72 0b aa 18. The
        two are clearly not the same, so when I enter
        'dnigo', the system compares the hash in the
        password database with the hash of 'dnigo,'
        finds that they are not the same and rejects my
        login attempt.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of a hashed password system is maintain
        system security even if an attacker has full
        access to the contents of the password file. If
        implemented correctly, even when an attacker is
        in possession of the password database, they are
        no closer to being able to correctly guess a
        user's password.Avoiding the Dictionary Attack
      </p>

      <p>
        The next type of attack we want to resist is the
        "Dictionary Attack." Password crackers have
        noted that users frequently use easy to remember
        passwords such as names, locations, proper
        nouns, and so on. Certainly something like
        "wilddingo" is easier to remember than
        "7G4kex8d09." Choosing such an easy to remember
        word or word combination greatly reduces the
        number of trial passwords an attacker will check
        before finding a correct password. To speed
        things along, some system adversaries took a
        dictionary of common words and ran each entry
        through the password hashing algorithm. A
        database was then constructed of common words
        and their hashes, sorted by the hash. Once this
        database is created, it is a simple task to see
        if a hashed password is in the database of
        hashed dictionary words. In the early days of
        secure computing, there were an embarrassing
        number of break-ins using this technique.
      </p>

      <p>
        To avoid the dictionary attack, modern systems
        will prepend a "random salt" to a password
        before applying the hash function. The salt is
        stored, unencrypted in the password database
        along with the salted and hashed password.
      </p>

      <p>
        The password generation process using salted
        hashes looks like this:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Prompt the user for a password.</li>
        <li>Generate a random salt (i.e.- a random string of bits.)</li>
        <li>Prepend the salt to the password.</li>
        <li>Hash the salted password.</li>
        <li>Store the salt and the salted password in the password database.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The process of checking the password is now:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Retrieve the user's salt from the password database.</li>
        <li>Prompt the user for a password.</li>
        <li>Append the password to the salt.</li>
        <li>Hash the salted password.</li>
        <li>Compare the result from step 4 with the salted password in the password database.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The purpose of the salt is to increase the
        number of "dictionary entries" for each
        password. When storing a non-salted hashed
        password, an attacker would only have to
        pre-calculate one hashed password for each
        password to populate his dictionary. With salted
        passwords, the attacker would have to create a
        dictionary entry for each pair of salt values
        and common words.

      <h2>Generating Keys From Passwords</h2>

      <p>
        Another application of passwords is what's
        called Password Based Encryption (or PBE.) PBE
        is technique for generating an encryption key
        from a password.
      </p>

      <p>
        PKCS#5 is one of the more popular PBE
        methods. It specifies the following algorithm:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Generate a random salt.</li>
        <li>Append the salt to the user's password.</li>
        <li>Hash the salted password.</li>
        <li>Hash the hash of the salted password.</li>
        <li>Repeat step four some fixed number of times.</li>
        <li>Use the resulting hash as an encryption key to encrypt a message.</li>
        <li>Prepend the salt and iteration count (the number of times you hashed the hash) to the encrypted message.</li>
        <li>Store or send the message.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Password Based Encryption is useful when you
        want to send an encrypted message to someone and
        distribute the decryption key via some out of
        band method; perhaps you are planning on phoning
        the recipient or writing down the password on a
        piece of paper and hand delivering it. When the
        message recipient has the encrypted message and
        the password, they decrypt the message with the
        following algorithm:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Recover the salt and iteration count from the beginning of the message.</li>
        <li>Prompt the user for the password.</li>
        <li>Append the salt to the password.</li>
        <li>Hash the salted password.</li>
        <li>Hash the previously generated hash until you have hashed N times (N being the iteration count from the message header.)</li>
        <li>Use the resulting hash as a key to decrypt the message.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Hash Algorithm Should I Choose?</h2>

      <p>
        System developers should understand that what
        might be a good hash algorithm today could
        easily become a vulnerability tomorrow. Several
        message digest algorithms were well regarded for
        years before viable attacks were discovered
        against them. At the time this document was
        written, the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) family
        of hash algorithms were among the most widely
        used and well regarded. One should note that the
        original SHA algorithm (now called SHA0) was
        found to have some weaknesses. The revised SHA-1
        algorithm is still considered a good
        choice. SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 are new
        additions to the SHA family that are internally
        very similar to the SHA-1 algorithm.
      </p>

      <p>
        In general, you should choose a hash algorithm
        that produces twice as many bits as you need for
        your encryption algorithm. For instance, if you
        were generating a password-based key for use
        with the DES algorithm, SHA-1 would be an
        acceptable choice for hashing your salted
        password. This is because DES uses a 56 bit key
        and SHA-1 produces 160 bits of output. SHA-1 is
        therefore acceptable for generating up to 80 bit
        keys. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is
        capable of using a 128, 192, or 256 bit key. You
        would therefore want to use SHA-256, SHA-384, or
        SHA-512 to generate your key.

      <h2>Best Common Practices for Software Developers</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Do not store passwords "in the clear."<ul>
          <li>Store a salted hash of a password in the password database.</li>
          <li>Choose a reputable hash algorithm such as SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 when producing the password hash.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Consider creating a system that supports multiple hash functions. Support an administrative interface that allows the system management staff to disallow the use of a particular algorithm if it is "broken."</li>
        <li>Only consider storing passwords "in the clear" if there is a clear performance penalty with using hashed passwords and the passwords are stored in a physically secured tamper-resistant memory module.</li>
        <li>Require the user to assign a new password when an account is created. Do not use default passwords for new accounts.</li>
        <li>Support an administrative interface that allows system management staff to require passwords to:<ul>
          <li>have a minimum number of upper case letters</li>
          <li>have a minimum number of lower case letters</li>
          <li>have a minimum number of digits</li></ul></li>
        <li>Consider checking user supplied passwords against a dictionary of common words. If a user's password is a common word, alert the user that the password may not be secure.</li>
        <li>If you check passwords against a dictionary of common words, support an administrative interface that allows system management staff to add new common words or new dictionaries against which passwords are checked.</li>
        <li>After accepting a password from a user, then salting and hashing it's contents, write over the buffer that stored the password with zeros.</li>
        <li>If you need to cache a password, cache the salted hash of the password and not the password itself.</li>
        <li>If you need to create a symmetric encryption key from a pass-phrase, use a password based encryption algorithm such as described in PKCS#5 or PKCS#12.<ul>
          <li>Choose random salts of appropriate length: 80 bits should be sufficient for most applications.</li>
          <li>Hash at least 1000 times.</li></ul></li>
        <li>For web applications, do not store encrypted passwords in client-side cookies. Consider using some other cookie-based authenticator.</li>
      </ul>
