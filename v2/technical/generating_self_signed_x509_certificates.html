    <title>Generating Self-Signed X.509 Certificates</title>

      <p>
        People who know me know that I love to dis on
        X.509 based security solutions. Whether it's
        implementations that just plain ignore basic
        constraints, or popular certification
        authorities that add an extra zero byte to the
        end of their certs... it's all just so much fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it's hard to argue with the utility of a
        properly configured TLS layer. And until we add
        a TLS extension for using OpenPGP to cart around
        public keys in TLS handshake sequences, we're
        sort of stuck with X.509.
      </p>

      <p>
        I spend a surprising amount of time generating
        self-signed certificates for testing, so a few
        decades ago I came up with a bash script to
        eliminate the drudgery of this process. If
        you're interested, just grab a copy from GitHub
        at: <a href="https://gist.github.com/OhMeadhbh/6201808">https://gist.github.com/OhMeadhbh/6201808</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To use it, just copy and paste it from the gist
        page into a file you've chmod +x'd. To use it,
        just run the script passing the name of the host
        you're generating a certificate for as the first
        parameter. It defaults to making 2048 bit keys
        with no passwords, so don't use this to generate
        production certs (not that you should be using
        self-signed certificates in a production
        environment anyway.)
      </p>

      <p>
        So if I wanted to create a certificate for
        www.example.com, and I named the script gssc, i
        would invoke it like so:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   gssc www.example.com</pre>

      <p>
        and it would generate two files:
        www.example.com.key and www.example.com.crt. The
        former contains the private key and the latter
        is the X.509 certificate for www.example.com.
      </p>

      <p>
        The -b, -p and -s options allow you to change
        the length of the private key, the password to
        encrypt the private key and the certificate's
        subject name. So if I wanted to create a 1024
        bit private key, encrypted with the password
        "blargh" and with the subject name "C=IO,
        ST=Chacos, L=Diego Garcia, CN=www.example.mil,"
        I would use this command:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   gssc www.example.mil -b 1024 -p blargh \
     -s "/C=IO/ST=Chacos/L=Diego Garcia/CN=www.example.mil"</pre>

      <p>
        And for completeness sake, here is a copy of the
        script if you don't want to (or can't) grab it
        from the GIST referenced above:

   # This script uses openssl to generate a self-signed certificate. Usage is
   # like this:
   #   gssc <host name> [-p password] [-s subject] [-b bitlength]
   # The host name parameter is the subject name of the certificate; i.e. - the
   # FQDN of the host you're generating a certificate for. This is also the base
   # name for the key, certificate signing request and certificate files. If you
   # want the key to be protected by a password, use the -p option to specify
   # it. The subject name of the requested cert defaults to:
   #   "C=US, ST=California, L=Felton, CN=<host name>"
   # You can select a differetn subject name by using the -s option and providing
   # a complete openssl style subject name. For example:
   #   "/C=IO/ST=Chagos/L=Diego Garcia/CN=foo.bar.mil"
   # will specify the expected subject name. Remember to put the slashes
   # in front of each clause and to put the Common Name (CN) entry (we don't
   # do it for you.) By default, we generate 2048 bit RSA keys. If you want some
   # other bit length, use the -b flag.
   #
   # For example, the following command generates a self signed cert for the
   # machine "secure.example.com" with a 1536 bit RSA key and a common name of
   # "C=US, ST=Montana, L=Bozeman, CN=secure.example.com":
   #   gssc secure.example.com -b 1536 -password "badpassword" \
   #       -s "/C=US/ST=Montana/L=Bozeman/CN=secure.example.com"
   #
   # This example creates a self signed cert for www.example.org with no password
   # on the private key and a subject name of "C=US, ST=California, L=Felton,
   # CN=www.example.org":
   #   fssc www.example.com
   #
   # Cheers!
   
   # Check to see if we provided a host name
