    <title>Goldilocks and the 11 Parsers</title>

    <section>

      <p>
        Once upon a time there was a programmer, lost in
        the requirements specification.
      </p>

      <p>
        "If only I had a standard parser to communicate
        structured dynamic data!" she said.
      </p>

      <p>
        As chance would have it, hidden behind a
        footnote in subsection 4 of paragraph 14, she
        spied ITU X.680 and X.690.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Oh!" she exclaimed, "I am saved! For the system
        described in these documents provides near
        infinite flexibility to represent even the
        smallest semantic nuance." And off she went down
        to the river to code an implementation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weeks later she emerged from the forest
        disheveled and half-starved. "ASN.1 tricked me!"
        she complained, "What I thought was flexibility
        was merely underspecification wrought from the
        inability of a technical committee to find
        agreement on implementation details. If I
        continue on this path I will be forced to decide
        between adherence to an often-vague
        specification or an implementation with decent
        performance. Most likely I will code only to the
        subset of the specification I intend to use
        leading to long-term brittleness and possibly
        security vulnerabilities based on incomplete
        understanding of a confusing specification." In
        reward for her understanding she was named as a
        director of the IETF Applications Area.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two years later the programmer returned to her
        specification, tired of mediating technical
        disputes between commercial interests who were
        attempting to find competitive advantage by
        scuttling each other's proposals while
        simultaneously advancing the bare minimum
        specification required for a viable protocol.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Clearly XML is the way to go," she said, "with
        its mix of representational flexibility and
        optional enhancements." And away she did go,
        coding real-time applications using XML to
        transfer data between loosely coupled
        manufacturing-floor process-control
        equipment. Everything was fine until it came
        time to integrate a newer version of the
        Smerxerces XML parser that referenced a version
        of libboost that did not run on their MIPS-based
        process control system due to a compiler bug.
      </p>

      <p>
        After reading the code for Smerxerces, trying to
        understand why it was coded to require behavior
        specific to a particular version of libboost she
        said to herself, "Most of my requirements for
        data transfer are relatively simple, not
        requiring the expressive power of XML. What's
        more, we were forced to reduce the requirement
        that XML input be 'well formed' instead of
        'valid' because XML components produced by
        non-coordinating, loosely coupled data systems
        do not test their components with each other and
        frequently reference schemas or DTDs which are
        unavailable to the public.
      </p>

      <p>
        In reward for her new-found enlightenment she was named
        to the ACM Publications Board, a position of great
        respect and moderate power within her community.
      </p>

      <p>
        After two years of defending the ACM's policy to
        retain it's paywall, she quietly resigned to
        volunteer with the Internet Archive and EFF to
        atone for her mercantile sins. One day at the
        Internet Archive she saw a web developer cursing
        incompatibilities between browsers with respect
        to JSON parsing.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Eureka!" she exclaimed, "Clearly JSON is the
        transfer syntax of a new generation!"
      </p>

      <p>
        "All hail JSON!" she said to no-one in
        particular, "It eschews schema, working only as
        a transfer syntax allowing higher layers of the
        system to make decisions regarding missing or
        extra data in a protocol data unit!"
      </p>

      <p>
        She turned this new-found discovery into a
        well-regarded TED talk and was rewarded by being
        named AOL's Internet of Things Architect.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the IoT Architect she encouraged
        manufacturers of 4 and 8 bit sensors to produce
        PDUs using JSON. When visiting a vendor site she
        happened upon a Pacific Coast Mountain Octopus
        crafting a small parser to run on an 8 bit
        micro-controller powered only by the RF-field of
        an NFC card reader.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Above. Around. Within." said the Octopus,
        "Context and regarding; limits and failure." But
        alas, she did not speak Octopus. The octopus
        then flashed a series of patterns on its skin,
        communicating sub-consciously using the language
        of dreams. But of course humans do not listen to
        their dreams during the day, so she had to wait
        for REM sleep for her brain to attempt to
        convert the flashing patterns into long-term
        memories.
      </p>

      <p>
        In her dreams the Octopus said "Your
        appreciation for the simplicity of JSON has
        blinded you to the type semantics embedded in
        it's specification. We are facing issues because
        there is no sub-specification in JSON to allow a
        consumer to identify its type semantics. JSON
        does a good job of delimiting protocol data
        units, but fails completely to handle the case
        where a consumer supports only 8 or 16 bit
        integers, or 64 bit integers for that matter."
      </p>

      <p>
        Because it was a dream, the Octopus then changed
        into David Bowie and threw minnows at her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Changing back into an Octopus, it continued,
        "The transfer syntax itself doesn't describe the
        protocol interactions required to establish the
        type behavior of the consumer, but it can signal
        that the data provider 'promises' to use values
        within a given range. This doesn't completely
        solve the problem, but it allows the consumer to
        decide before-hand what to do when it receives
        data it may not be able to semantically
        consume."
      </p>

      <p>
        And with this, the programmer woke, with
        near-mystical understanding of the Octopus'
        message.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like Goldilocks she had wandered into the forest
        and found ASN.1 to be too heavy, weighted down
        with explicit type semantics. XML eschewed type
        semantics, but it's extensibility allowed
        producers to identify semantic intent in
        documents or document schemas, requiring
        consumers of XML to check both locations. XML
        too, was too heavy. JSON eschewed schema, making
        it "lightweight." But it was too lightweight in
        that it ignored type semantics of the consumer.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that is when the programmer devised a fourth
        parser, one with the simplicity of JSON, but
        without JSON's embedded type semantics. She
        later hired 11 bears as interns to code the new
        parser which consumed data that looked
        suspiciously like JSON, but added support for
        in-band directives APDU producers use to
        communicate to the consumer the type semantics
        they intend to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        And they all lived happily ever after.
      </p>

      <p>
        Until someone pointed out that JSON doesn't
        support comments and since they were changing
        things, maybe add support for comments?
      </p>
