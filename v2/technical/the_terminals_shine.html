        Getting ready to start my day, doing a couple
        little tasks while watching AMC's Halt & Catch
        Fire in the background. I really love the show;
        mostly 'cause it's like re-living the
        microcomputer revolution. Kids today don't know
        what it was like. Every month something new and
        innovative came out. Most of the things that
        came out withered and died 'cause they were too
        expensive or the market for the product didn't
        really exist.

      <p>
        But at the time, that didn't matter too much. It
        was a crazy time and there were no rules. Or
        rather, people were more willing to creatively
        bend them. I was on the tech side of the fence
        in the 80s and was privileged to work on
        firmware, application programs and even an
        operating system to compete with MacOS and
        Microsoft Windows. I wrote a lot of very cool
        code, but strangely, the only thing that's still
        in use from back in the day is some code for
        older ATM machines & a hack i wrote for DOS /
        Netware.

        The common misconception of the 80's was
        software was written by lone coders working
        feverishly through the night. That's not
        completely untrue, but there were plenty of
        small organizations: three or four coders
        working together to get stuff done. (Remember,
        this is back when version control was flinging
        floppies around the room.)

        One of my favorite bits of writing from the time
        is this bit from Geoffrey James:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   "The computer center is empty,
   Silent except for the whine of the cooling fans.
   I walk the rows of CPUs,
   My skin prickling with magnetic flux.
   I open a door, cold and hard,
   And watch the lights dancing on the panels.
   A machine without soul, men call it,
   But its soul is the sweat of my comrades,
   Within it lie the years of our lives,
   Disappointment, friendship, sadness, joy,
   The algorithmic exaltations,
   The long nights filled with thankless toil,
   I hear the echoes of sighs and laughter,
   And in the darkened offices
   The terminals shine like stars."
                    --from The Tao of Programming</pre>
