        <em>(this may sound like me bashing SAP. it's
          not. read on)</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The benefits of Enterprise Resource Planning
        software do not come from the software itself,
        but from the changes you need to make to use the
        software.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you've ever been involved in a SAP R/3
        roll-out, you know it's not an easy
        process. Ditto for PeopleSoft, Oracle and
        Siebel. Most organizations use ERP software
        because they've grown large enough that
        home-grown solutions like emailing spreadsheets
        and keeping your HR docs in a SharePoint
        instance just don't work any more.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time your organization begins a SAP (or
        Oracle, or Xero, or ...) roll-out, you've lost
        customers or large piles of money (or both)
        because of miscommunication or business process
        inefficiency. The problem has made it's way to
        C-level guys, if not the board. By the time the
        corporation decides to spend the money and
        disrupt the business' status quo, the need is
        often dire.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point you call in the SAP Post-Sales
        support staff who start asking you a lot of
        questions about your business & your internal
        processes. They need to know the answers to
        these questions in order to configure various
        R/3 applications. But if you're like a typical
        SAP customer, your answer to a lot of these
        questions is... "Hunh. I don't know how we do
        that."
      </p>

      <p>
        And then management finds out you're off-track
        with the R/3 roll-out and they either yell (bad
        managers) or start asking what they can do to
        fix it (good managers.) Eventually a business
        process consultant is hired and they start
        asking questions, looking for answers like
        "Yeah. We don't know why we do it that way. Bob
        set it up that way a couple years ago before he
        retired."
      </p>

      <p>
        And there are ALWAYS a lot of answers like this.
      </p>

      <p>
        After six months, just about everyone has talked
        to the business process consultant and he's
        built a reasonable model of your company. He
        gives your COO a thick binder filled with
        findings and recommendations. Over the next
        three months, they're phased in, R/3 apps are
        re-configured and your company goes live.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following quarter everyone begins to realize
        how smoothly routine tasks are running. Sure,
        there are corner-cases that require people
        running around and some creative data entry, but
        those are the exceptions. Much less time and
        money is spent on routine business tasks
        (filling orders, tracking manufacturing, HR
        processes, expense reporting/reimbursement,
        budget forcasting, etc.)
      </p>

      <p>
        And then everyone talks about how GREAT the R/3
        suite is.
      </p>

      <p>
        And it is pretty decent software. But here's the
        thing; about 80% of the benefits you received
        didn't come from the software itself, but from
        being open to the idea of modeling your business
        processes so they could be automated.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that's why I say "using SAP R/3 does not
        make your enterprise better." After you modeled
        your business, you could just as easily
        continued to use emailed spread-sheets and
        half-broken wikis and you would still be a MUCH
        better business. That being said, you would
        probably quickly discover sharing data via
        spread-sheet is pretty sub-optimal and would
        move to something like R/3 or Oracle
        Financals/Fusion/Whatever.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I like to remind CEOs & COOs that ERP
        software is not a magic bullet. Everyone has to
        dig into their daily tasks, figure out what
        their business processes are and how they
        inter-relate. And THAT is where the real
        benefits come from.
