        <em>(In which I make the argument that using a configuration file (or two) is a better idea than setting the NODE_ENV environment variable and propose the use of the SN Props package to make this process easier.)</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Like everyone else in the node community, I
        started out using the NODE_ENV environment
        variable to set various details in my apps. I
        would do something like this to start an app:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   $ NODE_ENV=dev /usr/bin/node foo.js</pre>

      <p>
        The shell would set the environment variable
        NODE_ENV to the string "dev" and launch the
        foo.js node application. Inside foo.js, we would
        do something like this:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   var port, host;

   if( "prod" === process.env.NODE_ENV ) {
     port = 80; host = "0.0.0.0";
   } else if( "dev" === process.env.NODE_ENV ) {
     port = 8080; host = "127.0.0.1";
   } else {
     console.log( "ERROR: unsupported NODE_ENV value: " +
       process.env.NODE_ENV );
     process.exit(1);
   }

   // insert other code here

   server.listen( port, host );</pre>

      <p>
        And honestly, there's nothing seriously wrong
        with this. It lets you express different
        application behavior based on whether you're
        running in development-mode or if you've
        deployed to production. But then I saw this:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   var port, host, db_pass;

   if( "prod" === process.env.NODE_ENV ) {
     port = 80; host = "0.0.0.0"; db_pass = "tq6TJwFR";
   } else if( "dev" === process.env.NODE_ENV ) {
     port = 8080; host = "127.0.0.1"; db_pass = "2qpwRfKB";
   } else {
     console.log( "ERROR: unsupported NODE_ENV value: " +
       process.env.NODE_ENV );
     process.exit(1);
   }

   // insert code to connect to the database here

   server.listen( port, host );</pre>

      <p>
        And where did I see this? In the source
        repository, of course.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now I don't want to be too snobbish, I've
        written apps that check the password into the
        source repo before. At the time I thought it was
        a simple, throw-away app that no one would use
        after a couple months. By the time the
        black-hats found this in the source repo, the
        app would be long-retired. Except that's never
        the way the world works. The code got used by a
        different group in the organization and then
        sold to a third party. By the time I heard what
        had happened, one of the third parties had lined
        up a SAS-70 audit they may have failed because
        of a fixed password in the system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moral of the story? Don't hard-code database
        passwords into your app.
      </p>

      <p>
        "But what does this have to do with NODE_ENV
        being an anti-pattern?" you ask.
      </p>

      <p>
        Simple, using NODE_ENV to set application
        behavior makes it easy for a developer to do bad
        things (like hard-coding dev &amp; production
        environment passwords into the app.) In my apps,
        I've replaced the use of NODE_ENV with what I
        call the "Concatenated Config" pattern.
      </p>

      <h2>Avoiding Application Brittleness with the
        Concatenated Config Pattern</h2>

      <p>
        Instead of setting my config parameters from an
        environment variable inside the code, I use
        multiple JSON files to hold config settings and
        import them as a javascript object. The
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sn-props">SN
          Props</a> package does all the heavy lifting
        for you. So now, I launch an app like this:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   $ node ./bar.js \
     --config file:///opt/bar/dev.json \
     --config file:///opt/bar/db_dev.json</pre>

      <p>
        SN Props reads the command line looking for URLs
        pointing to JSON files. In this example, it
        grabs the files /opt/bar/dev.json and
        /opt/bar/db_dev.json, smooshes them together and
        passes them to your app via a callback. Here's
        what the code in bar.js looks like:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   require( 'sn-props' ).read( function( props ) {
     // db connection setup code goes here
     // http server code goes here
    } );</pre>

      <p>
        And the contents of the two config files look
        something like this:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>/opt/bar/production.json:</strong>
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   {
     "listen": {
       "port": 8080,
       "host": "127.0.0.1"
     }
   }</pre>
      
      <p>
        <strong>/opt/bar/db_db002.json:</strong>
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   {
     "mysql": {
       "host": "127.0.0.1",
       "port": 3306,
       "user": "dev",
       "pass": "goats!"
     }
   }</pre>

      <p>
        and, of course, you probably want to define
        other configs to use in production:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>/opt/bar/production.json:</strong>
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   {
     "listen": {
       "port": 80,
       "host": "0.0.0.0"
     }
   }</pre>

      <p>
        <strong>/opt/bar/db_db002.json:</strong>
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   {
     "mysql": {
       "host": "db002.internal.example.com",
       "port": 3306,
       "user": "bar",
       "pass": "JC7VwyguUqHm8D3J"
     }
   }</pre>

      <p>
        And if you trust your internal infrastructure,
        you can replace references to file: URLs with
        references to http: URLs. You can probably
        figure out what this does:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

   $ node ./bar.js \
     --config https://config.example.com/dev.json \
     --config file:///opt/bar/db_dev.json</pre>

      <p>
        Let's Recap:
      </p>

      <p>
        The benefits of this pattern are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>It discourages hard-coding passwords and other config information into the applications source. (i.e. - it discourages something that would make your app brittle and possibly insecure.)</li>
        <li>It lets your DevOps team change configuration details like DB particulars &amp; which port and IP address your app listens on without having to touch the app code.</li>
        <li>If you trust your internal infrastructure, you can put all of your app configuration information on a single http(s) instance.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There are a few draw-backs, but they're
        relatively mild:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Command line invocations are a little longer</li>
        <li>There are (potentially) multiple places to look when there's a configuration error</li>
        <li>A malformed JSON config file will cause your app to not launch.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In my experience, the benefits outweigh the
        drawbacks. I no longer embed application policy
        in the code itself; instead, i put it in a
        configuration file that's has slightly different
        access control and logging settings.
