    <section id="00_Intro"><p>
      Sometimes I write technical words. Other times I
      do technical things.
    </p>

    <p>
      And when I write about technical things, I mostly
      write to communicate concepts or "wisdom" I've
      learned the hard way. The first bit of technical
      wisdom here is a story about parsers, messages and
      loosely coupled systems called "<a href="goldilocks_and_the_11_parsers.html">Goldilocks
      and the 11 Parsers</a>" (remember, in binary, "11" is how you
      write out the number "3".)
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the more popular technical things I wrote
      was the "<a href="strange_programmer_habits/index.html">Strange
      Programmer Habits</a>" series. Originally on a
      long-forgotten blog, it inspired a number of
      seasoned programmers to either violently agree
      with me or tell me I was an idiot.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next bit of wisdom is a (very) short essay
      based on my experience helping customers adopt ERP
      (Enterprise Resource Planning) software packages
      and in writing ERP software. The essay "<a href="using_sap_software_does_not_make_your_enterprise_better.html">Using
      SAP Software Does Not Make Your Enterprise
      Better</a>" probably sounds like it's going to be
      a slam on SAP R/3, but it's not. For the record,
      I'm a fan of SAP software; but not all
      organizations are ready for SAP. My assertion here
      is that changing your organization so you can make
      use of ERP packages is *MUCH* more useful than the
      software itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The opinion article titled "<a href="on_the_usefulness_of_ar_vr_headsets.html">On
      the Usefulness of VR/AR Headsets</a>" is from an
      earlier time when everyone was going crazy about
      headsets. Having used VR and AR systems "back in
      the day" and watched the tools evolve over the
      last 25 years, I'm hoping to throw a tiny bit of
      cold water on the over-hyped expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're a fan of Virtual Worlds, you may be
      interested in the Virtual Worlds Region Agent
      Protocol (VWRAP). It was an attempt I helped
      manage at Linden Lab to standardize the "Next
      Generation Second Life Protocol."  I collected a
      number of blog posts and references and put them
      on the "<a href="what_is_vwrap.html">What is
      VWRAP?</a>" page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not all of my technical writing is abstract. When
      I hit on an interesting pattern (or anti-pattern)
      I like to write about it. One of the more
      controversial things I wrote was a simple article
      about how I preferred to put my app configuration
      settings in a place outside the app. This lets me
      change them without worrying I accidentally
      introduced a bug in my code. It also allows me to
      segregate access to the code vs. access to the
      config info. (This is important in many
      environments where they don't want app developers
      to have unfettered access to production system
      database passwords and the like.) If this is
      something that interests you, check out "<a href="is_node_env_an_anti_pattern.html">Is
      NODE_ENV an Anti-Pattern?</a>"
