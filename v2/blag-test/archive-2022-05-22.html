          As I age I become nostalgic for 80s media.
          I ran across this short film on the youtubes.
          Betaville, clearly a pleasant take-off on Godard's Alphaville.
          Which reminds me; I need to rewatch Alphaville sometime.

          Eagle-eyed viewers of Betaville (referenced above) will note the neon tunnel from 127 John St. &mdash; itself a popular location for photography and film projects.
          Fortunately someone thought to write a few paragraphs about this location: <a href="https://vassifer.blogs.com/alexinnyc/2012/06/walk-into-the-light.html">Flaming Pablum: Walk Into the Light</a>.

          All my life I thought this scene from Logan's Run was shot at 127 John St., but on closer inspection, I think it could be a reconstruction.
          What's cheaper?
          Fly a second unit to NYC for a single shot or re-create it in D/FW or Culver City?

          Mathieu Dejean interviews Alain Badiou regarding Emmanuel Macron and the degree to which modern politicians are human or fetishes for the ideal of freedom and agency.
          Worth a read and includes this marvelous quote:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="fill">
          Macron is the name of a crisis of any politics that purports to "represent" political orientations in an electoral space.
          That clearly owes to the fact that the earthly disappearance of the communist hypothesis and its parties has little by little made the truth about parliamentarism apparent:
          namely, that ultimately it only "represents" small nuances in the dominant consensus around neoliberal capitalism &ndash; and not any alternative strategy.
          The far Right, in the brutal style of Donald Trump or the renovated PÃ©tainism of Marine Le Pen, profits from this situation, since although it stands totally within that consensus it is alone in giving off the appearance of being on the outside.
        </blockquote>
