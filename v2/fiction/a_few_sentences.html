    <title>A Few Sentences Regarding Harold H. Harris, Sheriff of Madre de la Cruz, Arizona Territory and Editor of the Madre Monitor, Southern Arizona's Preferred Weekly Newspaper</title>

        "Mr. Harris," Alcalde Garcia started, "It's not
        that we don't appreciate you..."
      </p>

      <p>
        Sensing Garcia would be a while looking for the
        right phrase, Harris jumped in, "It's just that you
        don't think I'm a good Sheriff." He tried to make
        his tone less condescending, but wasn't doing a
        great job. "And it's SHERIFF Harris, if you
        please." Respect was hard currency in Madre de la
        Cruz and he wasn't about to give it away.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Sorry. Sorry. Yes, SHERIFF Harris," Garcia replied
        defensively. "No one wants you to stop being
        Sheriff."
      </p>

      <p>
        "I think you mean 'No one wishes to see your term
        as Sheriff expire,'" Harris corrected the old man
        instinctively.
      </p>

      <p>
        "There! You See! That's what I'm talking about,"
        Garcia complained, "You're always correcting
        people's speaking." Garcia saw the sheriff taking a
        deep breath, preparing for another long-winded
        exposition on proper grammar. "I mean people's
        English. I haven't seen you correct anyone's
        Spanish yet."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Si. Si. Mi Espa√±ol es no bueno," Harris responded
        with a remarkably good accent for someone whose
        Spanish language vocabulary was limited to the
        names of farm animals, numbers under forty and
        simple pleasantries. "But you knew how I worked
        when you hired me," Harris replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Yes Sheriff. We all knew you speak well when we
        hired you as editor of the Monitor," Garcia
        admitted, "But that's before we also hired you as
        Sheriff."
      </p>

      <p>
        The old alderman was about to reiterate the
        complaint when Angus Arlen burst into the office,
        shaking visibly with excitement. "SHERIFF! SHERIFF!
        COME QUICK! THE COACH HAS DONE BEEN ROBBED!" Harris
        winced visibly at the deputy's attempt at using the
        present perfect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years of editing news and classified advertisements
        had made Harold Harris a pedant, but it hadn't
        dulled his wits. If ever there was a time for
        action, this was it. The Sheriff quickly attached
        his gun-belt, grabbed his hat and made a mental
        note to go over examples of perfect tenses with
        Arlen at their earliest convenience.
