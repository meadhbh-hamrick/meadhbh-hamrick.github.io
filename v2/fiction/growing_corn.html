        “I don’t want to hear your philosophy if it doesn’t
        grow corn,” he used to say to me. It was a quote
        from an old geezer who lived on the reservation up
        the highway.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a perfect place he knew to picnic on
        Highway 200 behind a stand of trees. We used to go
        and eat and talk and make out. He knew the owner so
        it wasn’t trespassing, he said. In the summer it
        was perfect; it was just warm enough to take some
        of your clothes off and there was a cold stream to
        stick your feet in if you got too hot.
      </p>

      <p>
        We went up just about every day after he graduated;
        except Sunday. Sunday was for church -- I felt
        weird going to church in the morning and sneaking
        off to the woods in the afternoon. Every week I got
        the lecture about how much God loved me, and while
        it felt good to make out. Okay, okay, we were
        making love -- having sex. I don’t like that; just
        say we were making love. But I know God loves me,
        but making love felt too... it didn’t feel like a
        sin. Back then I was still a little unclear on my
        personal relationship with Christ. It seemed rude
        to hurt God’s feelings, but it still felt like it
        was okay.
      </p>

      <p>
        So we would be up there just about every day for an
        afternoon picnic. In the great outdoors with not a
        stitch of clothing between us; but it still felt
        safe. No one could see us but the songbirds. We
        talked about a lot of things; never about him
        leaving though. After making love we would lay back
        and try to see the clouds through the trees, saying
        which of our friends they looked like. I didn’t
        realize clouds could look like baseball players and
        cheerleaders and debate team captains, but they
        can. We talked a lot about writers; he said he
        wanted to go to college and become a writer.
      </p>

        He certainly did read a lot. That’s where he got
        the corn quote from. Or the quotes about
        religion. And the quotes about people. He had a lot
        of quotes handy and memorized some of the
        Shakespeare sonnets. I read them now and they sound
        funny; but when someone’s reading them to you...you
        just don’t know what it’s like ‘til someone does
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        One time I got very angry when he teased me about
        going to church every Sunday. “Religion is the
        opiate of the masses,” he said. I told him I didn’t
        like he would say things about my church; he didn’t
        know anyone there. They are all good people and
        help each other out; just like any religion tells
        you. Even humanism says it’s a good idea to be nice
        to each other, or at least that’s what I read.
      </p>

      <p>
        One time I started talking about how being kind
        sometimes means confronting people you love;
        kicking them in the butt, so to speak. But then he
        cut in with “your philosophy doesn’t grow corn!”
        and try to splash water on me.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of the summer I had finally gotten
        through to him. And for a couple weeks we had some
        really great times. Be patient, all ye sisters with
        well-read boyfriends; one day you will get a word
        in edgewise.
      </p>

      <p>
        The night before he left for the Marines we drove
        out one last time and lay under the trees. It was
        starting to get chilly at night, but there were
        still a few lightning bugs around. They were like
        little stars hung under the firmament of leaves and
        branches.
      </p>

      <p>
        I got a few letters from him when he was in
        training and a few more when he was overseas. They
        weren’t regular, but I could kind of tell things
        were rough. I think he was trying to hold on to
        anything normal in his life, so I would write him
        back telling him to stay safe so we could drive
        back out to our old picnic spot and he could tell
        me all about writers and philosophy.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are no secrets in a small town and everyone
        knew we were going steady. No one asked me to prom
        ‘cause they knew I would say no. My last quarter in
        school, everyone knew I was ready to be gone. When
        he got back from the Marines, we were going to both
        going to move to Northfield and give the “young
        couple in college” thing a try.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was weird when his father came over to the
        house. I don’t know what I was thinking he was
        doing there. His dad was the town dentist; I
        honestly thought he was coming to scold me for not
        brushing my teeth after lunch or something. We
        almost got all the way through it before we both
        broke down crying. First me, then his dad. He had
        died from wounds received during a firefight in an
        area that was supposed to be safe; that’s all I
        remember.
      </p>

      <p>
        I used to go out to our spot up on Highway 200 from
        time to time and scatter wild rice to try to get
        the songbirds to fly in close. It was always Blue
        Jays that would take the rice, but I guess that’s
        okay.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day I saw a couple of kids up near our old spot
        and thought it best to give them some distance. I
        guess our old spot wasn’t as private as I thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next summer I came home from Moorehead and
        asked his dad to go with me to church.. We sat in
        the back row while the preacher talked about
        forgiveness and light in the darkness and
        everlasting life. I don’t know if I believe in
        heaven; if there is an after-life, it’s better and
        different than this one. After the service we
        hugged and he walked up to look at a painting of
        Jesus on the cross. He looked at it like he saw
        something for the first time and slowly walked back
        out to the car.
