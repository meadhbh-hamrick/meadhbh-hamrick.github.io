      <p>
        that moment you realize you're going to wind up
        retiring to cleburne, texas and drive into waco
        twice a week to teach kids about '80s history
      </p>

      <p>
        and every day you'll walk past the town square
        where your grandfather played in the band before
        joining the marines & hanging out in cuba.
      </p>

      <p>
        and all the kids will look at you like you're some
        old fossil and they won't know. they won't
        know. they won't know what's authentic.
      </p>

      <p>
        with their play stations and their mobile
        phones. not one of them will know the joy of an
        honest to god analog synth...
      </p>

      <p>
        ...or the joy of breaking the rules and getting
        "high" off mexican skunkweed in the ditch behind
        the subdivision...
      </p>

      <p>
        ...while your parents are still at work and you
        turn to your best friend and ask "do you feel
        anything? i don't feel anything." you realize
      </p>

      <p>
        the crap you're smoking is total shit and you can't
        wait to leave texas because this town is full of
        little people with closed minds
      </p>

      <p>
        and you work hard to get through college only to
        discover professional life is a cavalcade of
        assholes and you remember that one night
      </p>

      <p>
        when the fireflies danced in the creek bed behind
        the house and you went out and looked at them and
        they flew all around you
      </p>

      <p>
        and carried you off to some firefly dimension
        beyond the human concepts of time and you woke up a
        little later realizing...
      </p>

      <p>
        you had just ingested maybe 6 or 8 of those purple
        microdots and had become unstuck in time and
        traveled the universe except
      </p>

      <p>
        you notice the universe is made out of cockroaches
        and they crawl all over you now but it's okay
        'cause it's beautiful and life is beautiful
      </p>

      <p>
        and you wake up and it's your retirement dinner at
        baylor where everyone talks about how
        christ-centered you are
      </p>

      <p>
        and you release a stream of verbal invective
        against the hypocrisy of modern religion and a
        university that makes you lie about your feels
      </p>

      <p>
        and everyone is shocked and looks away except this
        one young girl who's like maybe 19 and has this
        look on her face
      </p>

      <p>
        and it's the first time she's seen anyone speak
        truth to power and she doesn't know how to relate
        so she tries to be your lover
      </p>

      <p>
        and you have to tell her "no... no... i really am
        too old..." and you never see her again but hear
        she's working for an NGO
      </p>

      <p>
        trying to fix the world and then you snap back and
        realize life is a day-dream of a 12 year old 'cause
        you're bored at the scout meeting
      </p>

      <p>
        and it's okay. it's okay. the world is what it is
        and your attention is drawn back to the fireflies.
      </p>

      <p>
        and you wonder how you wound up in cleburne, texas.
      </p>

      <p>
        but it's okay.
      </p>
