      <h2>Ice Cubes as a Metaphor</h2>

      <p>
        Dr: "How have you changed since you've been
        released?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Well. I always have ice cubes in the freezer
        now."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Uh... Is that a euphemism?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "No. But think about it. I'm stable. I'm home
        on a regular basis. I always have potable water and
        i'm always mindful of when i have to refill the ice
        cube trays."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "You could get a fridge with an automated ice
        maker."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "That would be cheating. And besides, the ice
        gnomes who emerge from under my toe-nails at night
        would be offended."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Um... Who signed off on your release again?
        oh! it was me."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "No No. Just kidding. Ice gnomes? Under
        toe-nails? Kidding. I kid."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "whew"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Everyone knows ice gnomes come out of your
        navel."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Now you're just fucking with me, arent' you?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Only when my lips are moving, doc."
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Do I Care that Cause Precedes Effect?</h2>

      <p>
        Dr: "Go over that last bit again"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "The part about the fever leading to an
        infection?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Yes, that."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Well i had a fever which propagated backwards
        in time to the point most likely where i would have
        developed the infection."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Is that how you see the world working?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Mostly. Sometimes events aren't correlated in
        time."
      </p>

      <p>
        And this is how an undergraduate course in
        phenomenology led to an additional three weeks in
        the facility.

      <h2>The Capgras Delusion</h2>

      <p>
        Dr: "So tell me more about the impostors around
        you."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Not so much impostors. More like THE
        impostor."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Hmm. Your chart says you think people around
        you are impostors."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Oh, no. That's a mistake. I think
        metaphorically there is a 'person' who surrounds
        the 'real me' and sometimes blocks actions i want
        to take, sometimes does things I probably didn't
        really want to do. THAT is the impostor."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Well... I'm already scheduled on Oprah to talk
        about the Capgras Delusion. You don't think you
        could maybe scream a few things about everyone
        around you being replicas, could you? It would make
        my presentation a lot more interesting."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Oh Doc. I would if i could. I just can't get
        up a full head of steam to talk about something
        that's really sort of a metaphor. You know. While
        i'm in a straight jacket."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Hey. So. You wouldn't mind signing this
        waiver, would you?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "And all this time i thought you were a
        doctor."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "In the modern world, we are all insurance
        agents."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Is there a syndrome for that?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "APA membership syndrome?"
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>subject. object. duality. meh.</h2>

      <p>
        Me: "So... Doctor... Tell me how you felt when you
        realized you had sexual feelings towards your
        mother."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Wait a second... That's my line."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "It's okay. It's all part of the process. We're
        building empathy. And wouldn't you agree that
        empathy has to go both ways in order for the
        trans-formative affects of cognitive based therapy
        to be effective?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Uh... Sure... Have you studied psychotherapy?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Of course... How could i truly be crazy if i
        didn't understand the criteria by which i am judged
        insane?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "That's usually not considered a requirement."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "You would be amazed by the rational
        understanding held by most people commonly called
        'insane.'"
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Oh no. I completely believe it. I've seen
        plenty of 'rational' processes that serve to
        reinforce the ego-dream."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "But is it a rational process to repress
        distressing memories?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "ORDERLY! It's time for me to leave."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Now we're getting somewhere. why do you want
        to leave?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "This conversation is decidedly uncomfortable."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "You're not going to get very far wearing that
        straight jacket."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "HOLY CRAP! HOW DID I GET INTO A STRAIGHT
        JACKET!?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "It's always been there."
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>(a more realistic vignette from the facility)</h2>

      <p>
        Dr: "Okay... And i think we'll put you on a
        moderate dose of Welbutrin and follow up with blood
        tests in a week. and if you experience any side
        effects, just press the red button and tell one of
        the staff."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Aren't we supposed to do 'talking therapy'
        too?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Hmm.. Don't think it's covered by your plan."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "But if you look at the data, it shows that
        SSRIs work best in conjunction with cognitive based
        therapy."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Yeah. I've seen that data. It's fascinating."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "But no cogntive therapy?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Well. It's kind of expensive. But we have a
        great cafeteria here at the facility."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "But the data..."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Yeah. You're really going to have to talk to
        your plan administrator after you're released."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Uh oh."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Do you have a problem with your plan
        administrator? Your notes say you're argumentative
        sometimes."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Uh... No.. I mean... I AM the plan
        administrator."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "Hold on! Let me look up what Carl Rogers wrote
        about irony."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Oh fuck me."
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr: "No No. That's what Rogers wrote about the
        medical insurance industry."

      <h2>GRUPPE</h2>

      <p>
        Me: "Wanna talk about it?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Roommate: "Why i'm here?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Yeah."
      </p>

      <p>
        Roommate: "No"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Cool"
      </p>

      <p>
        Roommate: "If you want to talk, I don't care. Might
        take my mind off my own problems to listen to
        someone else's"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Yeah. I guess I don't want to talk about it
        either."
      </p>

      <p>
        Counselor: "TIME FOR GROUP! EVERYBODY! COME IN FOR
        GROUP!"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me (to roommate): "You want to make some shit up?
        Just so we have something to talk about in group?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Roommate: "Not so much. Making shit up is part of
        why i'm here."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Ooh. Good point."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me (a second later): "Uh-Oh"
      </p>

      <p>
        Roommate: "What?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Just realized not talking about it is probably
        part of why i'm here."
      </p>

      <p>
        Roommate (sarcastically): "I see we're making
        progress, today."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me (a second later): "Sure you don't want to make
        shit up?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Roommate: "You're not helping."
      </p>

      <p>
        Counselor (cheerily): "HEY GUYS! COME IN FOR
        GROUP!"
      </p>

      <p>
        Roommate: "Okay. I think i'm the king of france."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Really?"

      <p>
        Roommate: "No. Idiot. For group."
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Cool! I yelled at a customer for changing into
        a cheese wheel without permission."
      </p>

      <p>
        Roommate: "Oh! That's cool. Can i have that one!?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Sure. You take that one."
      </p>

      <p>
        Counselor (in the distance): "GROUP!"
      </p>

      <p>
        Me: "Okay... I planned the escape from the last
        facility i was in."
      </p>

      <p>
        Roommate: "No one escapes from Behavioural Health
        Stalag 13!"

        Me: "And i kept hearing these voices saying
        horrible, horrible things."

        Dr: "And do you still hear the voices?"
