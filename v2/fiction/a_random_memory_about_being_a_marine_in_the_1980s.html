    <title>A Random Memory About Being a Marine in the 1980s</title>

        Lt. Garrison paced as he lectured me. I wasn't
        really listening to the words he was saying; I know
        they weren't for me. He was doing his best to be
        seen to chastise three young wayward marines for
        not checking the list of off-limits bars. That was
        the arrangement, we had to sit through a sermon on
        the evils of gay bars and we would be released
        without our CO's finding out what happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        And we were all pretty sure we weren't supposed to
        mention Spitz and I had taken turns fucking his
        throat while the other two had been going to town
        on his ass.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I wondered if the MP's could see the traces of
        lipstick and glitter on his face. Did they know
        what was going on?  Were we all just going through
        the motions of some empty ritual to appease the
        bureaucracy who demanded arrests for moral
        infractions but at the same time didn't want to
        lose marines who contributed to the base's bottom
        line.
      </p>

      <p>
        Garrison (not his real name) was the twinkiest
        twink you ever cast eyes on and was a fixture at
        the local bar. He worked for the base's G-1
        (general staff / administration) so was involved in
        the occasional raids. The bar was officially a "no
        go" area. Not just this one, but several others in
        town, but this was the only off-limits queer bar.
      </p>

      <p>
        The story I heard was back in the day, the people
        up the chain of command got really freaked out when
        they heard there were queer marines and tasked a
        whole department with tracking them down. After a
        few weeks it became obvious how wide-spread
        homosexuality in the corps was (I know. Who would
        have thunk it. Tattooed men who like to travel and
        hang out in the gym are gay?)
      </p>

      <p>
        This was before DADT, so policy was set by local
        commanders. At Lejeune a small bureaucracy grew up
        around prosecuting queers. Word on the street was
        if your pro & con (productivity & conduct) marks
        were good, they mostly didn't mess with you. The
        "random" raids on the off-limits bars were down to
        about once per year; if you were in with the right
        crowd, you got word not to go out a particular
        night.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apparently someone changed the night of the raid
        and forgot to tell Garrison. We were out back in a
        van when the MPs burst in on a dozen queer marines
        playing pool and possibly sitting a little too
        close to each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our plan was initially to get dressed quietly and
        slip out the back. We had made our escape but
        someone recognized Garrison and asked if he was in
        on the raid. Dude must have thought saying "no" was
        a bad idea so he went along with it. He claimed he
        caught us bar-hopping heading towards the town's
        only gay bar.
      </p>

      <p>
        Turns out it was not that bad of a plan. We
        supposedly weren't in the bar, only on a random
        walk around the mean streets of Jacksonville. He
        later told me he also wanted to keep us close to
        him to avoid us getting sucked into "the system."
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a pretty solid plan, all things
        considered. But it did require keeping my mouth
        shut while getting a verbal reprimand for doing
        something less well connected marines were probably
        getting discharged for.
