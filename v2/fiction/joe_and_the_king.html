        "Be careful Joe," she said, "The King is the craftiest
        ring-writer this side of Yakima."
      </p>

      <p>
        "I know, I know," Joe replied, irritated. He knew the
        king's reputation. In the writing arena, few could contend
        with his prowess.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just then Joe's writing partner Carl pushed through the
        crowd to give him a few pearls of last minute
        wisdom. "Don't engage him with plot. I've seen him weave
        complications a fifth year philosophy student couldn't
        figure out." Carl meant well, but another distraction was
        the last thing Joe needed at the moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The writing arena itself was styled like a boxing ring from
        the old days. Two storytellers entered the ring and sat at
        old-fashioned typewriters at either corner. Along the
        periphery of the ring sat "The Editor," a complicated
        electro-mechanical device constructed with the sole purpose
        of evaluating the narrative structure of each contestant's
        output.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every sentence completed landed an invisible electric blow
        to the writer's opponent; the severity of the blow
        dependent on the editor's impartial calculation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many first time writer-contestants made the mistake of
        trying to emulate Orwell by prancing around with short,
        direct sentences. Sure, it's easy to craft a good short
        sentence, but it relies on context to deliver narrative
        impact. And context takes time to build.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a saying around the sparring table: "only Orwell
        can do Orwell."
      </p>

      <p>
        Others went full-on Bulwer-Lytton. These amateurs were
        usually knocked out by their opponents before they were
        able to complete their first sentence fragment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Good lit-boxers found a groove that worked for them. Joe
        specialized in "long, short, short" with a quizzical
        roundhouse. And that's how he started out his bout with The
        King.
      </p>

      <p>
        Joe's first paragraph was a solid one, introducing
        character and situation with a single vignette from a
        seemingly unimportant character's point of view. A few
        short sentences later and he had crafted the scene
        perfectly, and he landed the blow before the king could
        type out his first adjectival clause.
      </p>

      <p>
        Score one for Joe.
      </p>

      <p>
        The King was an old pro and hardly noticed Joe's opening
        salvo.
      </p>

      <p>
        The battle went on... Joe versus The King; sentence after
        sentence, line after line. The running narrative of both
        contestants being streamed live to social media. Joe was
        spinning a yarn about redemption and confidence in a
        post-cyberpunk dystopia. The King followed his muse down
        the narrative path towards gothic horror.
      </p>

      <p>
        Five rounds into the bout, the odds-makers started looking
        nervous. No one expected Joe to last this long. After ten
        rounds, the judge-mechanics started staring at the editor
        with worried looks. the machine could go on indefinitely,
        in theory. But after fifteen rounds small puffs of smoke
        began to emerge from the machine's cogs and wheels.
      </p>

      <p>
        The end came quickly -- The King jabbed at Joe with
        masterfully constructed plot twist. No one in the crowd saw
        it coming. But it was premature and confused the
        editor. Joe took the opportunity to drop in a sanguine
        reminiscence of his main character's childhood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe four or five humans who read it understood the
        emotional impact of the juxtaposition of childish innocence
        with the renewed hope that comes from ignoring
        experience. In later years the move would be called "Joe's
        Blake." but it was just enough to topple the weary king.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone in the arena that night got their money's
        worth. The King fell unconscious, sprawled upon the mat,
        his fingers seconds away from landing a solid punch.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ref held Joe's sore hand high, declaring the winner,
        "AND THE WINNER... BY KNOCK OUT AND DECISION... JOE BUSH OF
        SUMPTER OREGON!"
      </p>

      <p>
        No one hear Joe correct the ref... "Call me
        Ghost... Ghost-Writer."
