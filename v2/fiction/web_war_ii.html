        <em>This was originally for a 100-word story
          contest. I only just remembered it existed and
          figured it should live here...</em>

        "Captain Gecko reporting as ordered!" the
        middle-age, bedraggled officer said as he reported
        in. Colonel Layout returned his salute and gave his
        subordinate a quick glance. After years of Web Wars
        Gecko was still a solid soldier; frayed around the
        edges, but still solid.

        "Gecko," the colonel started. "This damned campaign
        has flipped over to quirks mode and reports are the
        border: just turned red. General staff fears it'll
        be dotted with holes after the next event loop"
      </p>

      <p>
        "Gecko, you have a right to know. Franky, we have
        reports..."
      </p>

      <p>
        The rest was lost in the scream of a page reload.
