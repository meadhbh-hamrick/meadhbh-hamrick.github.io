      <p>
        It was a rainy night; cold too. I got the call from
        5th precinct: another protocol had taken the long
        trip to nowheres-ville.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Whadda we got here, Charlie?" i asked O'Malley,
        the flatfoot in charge of keeping the press hounds
        at bay.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Not sure, sir" he mewled back. Something was
        wrong. O'Malley was shaken up. He was a good cop;
        something was definitely wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Okay, let's take a look at the corpse." O'Malley
        took a deep breath and lifted up the sheet. I
        gasped out loud; damn if it wasn't ol'
        Mr. Killer-App himself: EMail.
      </p>

      <p>
        I scouted the apartment for leads. This was gonna
        be a tough one. Mr. EMail had fallen in with a
        rough crowd late in life. Pictures of Nigerian
        princes covered the walls. Unused S/MIME keys
        littered the floor. Poor guy. Once a king, now an
        afterthought.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Hey! We caught this guy snooping around!" one of
        the shirts said pushing a punk kid in front of
        him. "Go on &amp; tell 'em your name"
      </p>

      <p>
        "He doesn't have to," I say, "I'd recognize young
        Mr. Orkut anywhere. Say... weren't you lost in the
        Amazon jungle or something?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "Amazon? What kind of chump do you take me for,
        copper?" said the young punk. "I've an honest job
        down in Rio. ask anybody."
      </p>

      <p>
        "Okay Orkut. I might just do that. But what with
        wave and buzz missing in action... you really want
        me talking to facebook?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "Okay copper, I'll tell ya' what ya wanna know. But
        i don't know what happened to buzz. I heard he
        retired and moved to Florida with Google Reader."
      </p>

      <p>
        That last bit hit like a punch in the gut. I had
        forgot about Reader's "retirement." They say it was
        her decision, but no one knows for sure. When you
        can't keep a classy dame like google reader safe on
        the streets and louts like G+ are running the show
        rather than cooling the sheets at Sun Quinten?
      </p>

      <p>
        It stinks, i tell you. Stinks. Like yesterday's
        session keys.
      </p>

      <p>
        The coroner finally arrived and started poking
        around the body. "HOLY SMOKES! HE'S NOT DEAD!" he
        says.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure enough, his breath just barely fogs the broken
        screen of my iPhone 6+. "O'Malley! get your guys to
        clear out the press, we need room to get Mr. EMail
        to the hearse.. er.. ambulance."
      </p>

      <p>
        So there i am leaning over the old jake, helping
        the coroner wrestle him onto a gurney. And then it
        hits me, his breath smells bad; real bad, the kind
        of bad you don't get naturally, like a mix of Hong
        Kong rot-gut and half refined Texas sweet crude. I
        used to catch a whiff of that smell whenever I went
        to the talkies cinema off shoreline road. It
        smelled... like Microsoft.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Hey Jay," I call to the coroner as he's wheeling
        EMail out the door, "while you're down at the
        hospital, get one of the saw-bones to test the old
        man for Exchange."
      </p>

      <p>
        "EXCHANGE!?" he cries back, "you don't think he's
        mixed up with the Bellevue mob, do you?"
      </p>

      <p>
        "I'm not sure, Jay. but test him anyway," I answer,
        "call it a hunch, i think i might have caught wind
        of a rat."
      </p>

      <p>
        The rest of the night goes like a million other
        nights: buried in paperwork and drowned by cheap
        scotch. As the sun rises through the acrid smog of
        Silicon Valley, I find myself lost in thought and
        mumbling to myself, "Microsoft, it can't be you,
        can it?"
      </p>
