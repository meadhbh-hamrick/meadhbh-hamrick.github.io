    <title>So There I Was in Abbottabad</title>

    <section>
      
      <p>
        and so there i was in abbottabad in february
        2002. i was working for a sili valley tech firm and
        had originally been on a trip to china to talk to
        one of our suppliers to calm them down after the US
        consumer tech market was going into the toilet
        after 9/11. somehow we decided we needed to fly to
        hyderabad to meet with some of the guys writing our
        software.
      </p>

      <p>
        meetings there took about ten minutes and concluded
        with us ending our relationship with that firm. but
        we still had three days until our return flight
        (yeah, we completely misread that situation.) my
        boss decides to try to catch an earlier flight
        home, but i'm happy to hang out in pakistan for a
        bit. i had worked here for a while back in the 80s
        and still had some friends up north.
      </p>

      <p>
        so i start making some phone calls and catch up
        with an old friend up in islamabad and we make
        plans to meet up. i'm able to catch a puddle-jumper
        up without too many problems. i'm waiting in the
        airport in islamabad to meet my friend and start up
        a conversation with some australians who were
        trying to make sense of the taxi stand.
      </p>

      <p>
        they're apparently here to do some sort of gig at
        bagram air base and are supposed to meet a rep from
        whatever the australian equivalent of the USO is,
        but they've been waiting for a few hours and so far
        no luck.
      </p>

      <p>
        my friend shows up at about this time and
        apparently thinks the band is with me and starts
        asking a bunch of questions about when i became a
        musician. by the time he figures out what's
        happening he's offered to help the guys out. he has
        a cousin who supposedly knows everyone up at bagram
        so he's pretty sure we can get this sorted out.
      </p>

      <p>
        so we pile into a black SUV and drive down to
        abbotabad (my friend's teaching at the local
        military academy there, which, if you know the
        pakistani military, you know that's kind of a big
        deal.) we get to his house (which is really more of
        a COMPOUND) and it's quite nice: fountain in the
        open area in the middle, a couple gardens and three
        separate buildings (not counting the building built
        into the wall of the compound.)
      </p>

      <p>
        and we're inside and learn he as a few kids. and
        the kids are all eager to practice their english on
        us and honestly... it's sort of amazing watching
        nine-year-olds speaking english, urdu and what i'm
        guessing is majhi.
      </p>

      <p>
        and then i see her. i'll call her leyla (not her
        real name.) we had met in the 80s in Skardu when i
        was trying to escape the horrors of war. for a
        brief period of time we courted. after spending a
        couple weekends together some form of guilt took
        hold and she demanded i follow the courting
        traditions of her people. that lasted for about ten
        minutes at a time since she couldn't really
        remember her people's courting rituals and couldn't
        keep up the pretense for more than that.
      </p>

      <p>
        her father was iranian and her mother was sikh. it
        made for a great combination in the 70s, but by the
        time war came around in the 80s both their families
        had disowned them for marrying "aliens." so here
        she was, beautiful as ever, married to my best
        friend from pakistan with two beautiful kids and a
        small army of domestic help.
      </p>

      <p>
        it's generally poor form in pakistan to try to
        manouver your best friends wife into a private
        conversation, but we were all modern adults and as
        long as we weren't gone too long, no one would
        care.
      </p>

      <p>
        leyla and i left skardu together. there wasn't too
        much for her there but a bad job for a crooked
        NGO. i was able to introduce here to the MCF guys i
        knew in peshawar. that's where she came in contact
        with my friend and after i returned home in the 80s
        they apparently married and fell in love.
      </p>

      <p>
        what i didn't know in the 80s was my friend was a
        spook. his cover job was as a bureaucrat for the
        army's logistics staff. what i suspect he was
        really doing was loading hash onto the backs of
        C-130s bound for the US. the reason i suspect that
        is after talking with leyla, he walked up and
        offered me a bowl of some truly excellent hash.
      </p>

      <p>
        now... if you're in a foreign country and someone
        offers you drugs, the most sensible thing to do is
        to refuse, jump up and feign indignation. or maybe
        you can muster real indignation. if so, good for
        you. play it for all you can cause drug laws in
        some foreign countries are positively medieval. but
        this was a good friend, who was effectively the man
        and we were in his private compound.
      </p>

      <p>
        "you ever think of what your life with her would be
        like?"  he asked. which is surprisingly forward for
        your typical pakistani gentleman.
      </p>

      <p>
        "sometimes," i lied.
      </p>

      <p>
        i thought of her, but never though of what might
        have been. there was no way i was going to stay in
        the war zone she called home and it was pretty
        unlikely she would move to texas. i just couldn't
        think of a future for us.
      </p>

      <p>
        "but our past was good enough," i said, "she seems
        happy, so things worked out."
      </p>

      <p>
        "she missed you for a while," he said, "she still
        does from time to time. but i think she is
        happy. and i am happy i can make her happy."
      </p>

      <p>
        "careful," i warned, "you'll turn into a soft
        american."  (this was a joke from back in the
        80s. he would chastise me for the sentimentality of
        american film while crying at the end of every sad
        drama we screened at the consulate.)
      </p>

      <p>
        "tell me of your wife," he said, moving the
        conversation to the present.
      </p>

      <p>
        "she's beautiful, and smart," i replied, "and
        willful."
      </p>

      <p>
        this brought out a laugh in my friend, "of course
        she is," he said, "you wouldn't abide a woman who
        wasn't as passive aggressive as yourself."
      </p>

      <p>
        and we kept on talking that night, drifting in and
        out of a pleasant high, ignoring the troubles of
        the world for one evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        the musicians found a casio keyboard and a cello in
        the house. their own instruments were on a flight
        to kabul. after dinner they played several
        songs. the one i remember was the one about a boat
        house. the woman playing the cello made it sing
        beautifully while the rhythm section made due
        banging on various pans and doors and chairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        and in the morning the musicians caught their
        flight to bagram and i returned home smuggling half
        a kilo of hashish in my luggage. my friend was
        killed a year later in the tribal areas up north;
        another casualty of an idiotic war.
      </p>

      <p>
        leyla moved back to tehran for a while, but her
        children are grown and she's gone back to work for
        MSF in syria, or at least that's what i hear.
      </p>

      <p>
        but i still think of her and how impossible our
        lives would be together. i remember wading in the
        icy water of the shigar river with her and watching
        her play with her children in abbottabad while i
        was stoned and listening to songs about boat
        houses.
      </p>

      <p>
        i think these memories should make me sad, but they
        don't. they're moments in time filled with
        uncomplicated joy that can never be erased.
