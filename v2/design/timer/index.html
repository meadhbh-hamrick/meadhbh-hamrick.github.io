      <p>
        I was looking for a device with two LCD digits
        that could count down 20, 30 and 60 seconds.  20
        seconds is for hand-washing.  30 seconds is for
        brushing teeth (you're supposed to spend 30
        seconds on each top/outside, top/inside,
        bottom/outside and bottom/inside.)  60 seconds is
        how long I'm supposed to swish my fluoride rinse.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea is simple, you press one of the buttons
        and a 20, 30 or 60 second timer starts and an LED
        illuminates, making the LCD background green.
        When the timer gets to 5 seconds, it turns
        yellow.  When it gets to 0 seconds, the
        background turns red and it beeps for 2 seconds.
        After those two seconds complete, the background
        LED is turned off and the beeping stops.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a three-way switch with positions: beep,
        custom and silent.  When it's in the "beep"
        position, it will beep when the timer expires.
        When it's in the "silent" position, it will not
        beep.  The "custom" position is reserved for
        future use, but for now, it does the same thing
        as the "beep" position.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's also a "SILENCE" button you can press if
        you forgot to flip it over into "silent" mode and
        don't want to listen to it beep.
      </p>

        Here, try it yourself.  I was originally thinking
        a thumbwheel on the side for the silent / custom
        / beep selector, but implemented it as radio
        buttons here.
