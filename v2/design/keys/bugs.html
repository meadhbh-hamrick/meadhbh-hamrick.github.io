      <h2>2021-07-23</h2>

      <p>
        First off, thanks to the Wednesday Group for
        encouragement and bug reports.
      </p>

      <p><b>Bug : It's not recognizing all my key presses</b></p>

      <p>
        After testing, it seems this is a problem with the
        implementation of key reporting in various
        keyboards. I read the USB spec once and it seemed
        to imply that you're supposed to be able to
        correctly report up to 8 simultaneous key or mouse
        events. I have a cheap Amazon Basics keyboard that
        doesn't quite do this. And a friend reported an
        older MacBook wasn't delivering all the key events
        required.
      </p>

      <p>
        So... you may need to try it with a different
        keyboard. But please let me know if you encounter
        problems with the mock-up recognizing keys. My
        contact info is on the
        <a href="../../../about.html">About the Author</a>
        page.
      </p>
      
      <p><b>Enhancement : What about the other hand?</b></p>

      <p>
        I'm an oldster; I mouse with my left hand (even
        though I'm right-handed.) I was kind of surprised
        to find how many other people over 40 do the same
        thing. Seems like once you flirt with tendinitis or
        carpal tunnel, it scares you into mousing
        off-hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        However... I get it that some people mouse with the
        other hand, so adding a left-hand / right-hand
        radio button to the interface might make the
        mock-up more useful. Maybe using the keys SPACE, F,
        D, S and A in "left hand mode" and SPACE, J, K, L
        and ; in "right hand mode".
      </p>
