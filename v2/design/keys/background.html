    <title>A Quick Word About Chorded Keyboards</title>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
        In the 1968 "Mother of All Demos"
        <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>, Doug Engelbart
        demonstrated several cutting edge technologies.
        They were still decades away from mass adoption,
        but in this video he demonstrated: computer
        networks, video conferencing, shared editing of
        a digital document and the computer mouse.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you blinked, you might have missed one
        particular user interface device: a Chorded
        Keyboard <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a>.
        Chorded keyboards were not new, though Engelbart
        might have been one of the first people to use
        them with a digital computer.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you look at a video of the demo
        <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a>, you can see Engelbart
        use the one-hand chorded keyboard at around the
        one minute mark. It's interesting to note it's
        only used while his other hand is on the mouse.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this demo, at least, Engelbart seems to think
        of the mouse and the chorded keyboard as a pair
        of components that make up the same
        computer-human interface. That's a distinction
        that may have been lost on modern computer users.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's no right or wrong way to use your
        computer, really. If it works, then it's
        probably "right." But the chorded demo page is
        intended to give people an easy way to test out
        one handed typing, just to see what it's like.

      <h2>Development</h2>

      <p>
        I've been using chorded keyboards on and off for
        several decades. One of my favourites is/was The
        FrogPad&trade; <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a>. Every
        interaction I had with Linda Marroquin was positive.
        But I guess my hands are smaller than what the
        FrogPad was designed for. And though my fingers never
        <i>hurt</i> while using it, it was mildly uncomfortable.
      </p>

      <p>
        While thinking about how I would improve the FrogPad, I
        started thinking about Engelbart's original Keyset <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>.
        It struck me that Engelbart's Keyset was the
        solution to the problem "how can I press a few keys
        with one hand while my other hand is resting on the
        mouse." This is slightly different from other modern
        chording devices that seek to replace the standard
        keyboard completely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around this time an acquaintance from the
        retro-computing community suggested I build
        something that looked vaguely like the original,
        but with a modern USB interface.
      </p>

      <p>
        After digging around I found references implying
        Engelbart's original Keyset used a very basic
        BCD-like mapping from key chord to character. This
        seemed a bit sub-optimal to me, so I set out to
        build a better experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The chord to key character mapping I found
        references to was a basic mapping of the 31
        different chords to 26 upper case letters and 10
        digits. This seems unlikely to me since 26 + 10 is
        greater than 31.
      </p>

      <p>
        My first requirement was that the keyboard have
        five keys, one for each finger. I wanted to try
        something different from the FrogPad; plus,
        Engelbart's original design was clearly a five-key
        affair.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        My next requirement was that the chord to character
        mapping be able to generate all the characters
        found on a modern keyboard: upper and lower case
        letters, digits, space, punctuation and random
        symbols like tilde (~) and the back-tick (`). I
        punted on arrow, PageUp, PageDown and other cursor
        movement keys because I felt positioning the cursor
        could be accomplished easier with the mouse.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being a fan of Jef Raskin's work in Computer-Human
        Interaction, I experimented originally with what he
        called "Quasi-Modes" <a href="#ref_6">[6]</a> to
        select different "sub-mappings" between chords and
        characters. The results were sub-optimal. Keeping
        one key pressed while manipulating the state of the
        other keys on a five-key Keyset proved
        uncomfortable and it didn't solve the original
        problem of extending the number of characters you
        could potentially select.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rejection of Raskin-like Quasi-Modes means the
        keyboard would be modal. In the first mode, pressing
        the first and second keys would result in an 'E' character
        being emitted while in a different mode maybe that
        same chord would emit the '0' character. I wanted to
        have a small number of modes, but enough to emit all
        the characters of a standard modern keyboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point I should digress and mention I'm
        limiting the current version of the Keyset mapping
        to English / Latin characters. I am personally
        interested in adding ß, Ø and diacritics like tilde
        (◌̃) , grave (◌̀), acute (◌́), umlaut / diaeresis (◌̈),
        circumflex (◌̂), macron (◌̄), cedilla (◌̧), overring
        (◌̊) and caron / háček (◌̌), but I'm probably going
        to require the input of native Czech, German,
        French, Italian, Spanish and Scandinavian typists
        before I can do justice to those languages'
        alphabets. Cyrillic and Greek alphabets are also
        currently unsupported. My suspicion is it would be
        hard to wedge such alphabets into the current
        mapping. I'm happy to support anyone who wants to
        adapt the ideas here to other alphabets, but have
        to admit my own inexperience with non-European
        languages prevents me from trying to do such work
        myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once I decided the mapping would be modal, I wanted
        to make it easy to set the mode to a known good
        state. Imagine you're typing a few characters and
        you get distracted. What mode is your Keyset in?
        My solution was to have one of the 31 chords be a
        "reset to the first mode" ([TOP]) command. And if
        we're modal, you need a "next mode" ([NEXT])
        command. These keys were going to get pressed a
        lot, so it made sense to make them to single-finger
        chords. Other very common key presses were
        "backspace" ([BS]), "enter" ([ENTER]), and the
        space bar ([SPACE]).
      </p>

      <p>
        That seemed pretty good, one-finger chords assigned
        to each of the common operations.  But during
        testing I discovered I have a very weak pinkie
        finger. It doesn't like to be used that much. So I
        moved the [TOP] command to a two finger chord and
        started thinking about producing actually
        characters.
      </p>

      <p>
        I found a character frequency chart for English
        somewhere and assigned vowels to various two key
        chords, taking care to assign 'U' (the least
        common vowel) to a two key chord that uses the
        pinkie finger.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rest of the letter to chord mappings follow
        the frequency of letters, assigning chords in
        the order: two finger chords (without pinkie),
        three finger chords (without pinkie), two finger
        chords (with pinkie) and then three, four and
        five finger chords with the pinkie finger.
      </p>

      <p>
        Assigning digits followed a similar scheme. More
        frequently used digits (like 0, 1, 2 and 3) would
        be assigned to two and three finger chords
        without the pinkie. Other symbols were assigned
        more or less at random.
      </p>

      <p>
        So despite appearances, the mapping between
        chords and keys is not completely random.
