    <title>A Quick Word About Chorded Keyboards</title>

    <sectionid="01_Contents">

      <p>
        In the 1968 "Mother of All Demos"
        <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>, Doug Engelbart
        demonstrated several cutting edge technologies.
        They were still decades away from mass adoption,
        but in this video he demonstrated: computer
        networks, video conferencing, shared editing of
        a digital document and the computer mouse.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you blinked, you might have missed one
        particular user interface device: a Chorded
        Keyboard <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a>.
        Chorded keyboards were not new, though Engelbart
        might have been one of the first people to use
        them with a digital computer.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you look at a video of the demo
        <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a>, you can see Engelbart
        use the one-hand chorded keyboard at around the
        one minute mark. It's interesting to note it's
        only used while his other hand is on the mouse.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this demo, at least, Engelbart seems to think
        of the mouse and the chorded keyboard as a pair
        of components that make up the same
        computer-human interface. That's a distinction
        that may have been lost on modern computer users.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's no right or wrong way to use your
        computer, really. If it works, then it's
        probably "right." But the chorded demo page is
        intended to give people an easy way to test out
        one handed typing, just to see what it's like.
