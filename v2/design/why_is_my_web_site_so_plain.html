    <title>Why Is My Web Site So Plain?</title>

    <a name="00_Intro"></a>
    <section id="00_Intro"><p>
      The Shaker hymn "Simple Gifts" tells us there are
      spiritual benefits to leading a simple life.
    </p>

    <blockquote><p>
      ’Tis the gift to be simple, ’tis the gift to be free<br/>
      ’Tis the gift to come down where we ought to be,<br/>
      And when we find ourselves in the place just right,<br/>
      ’Twill be in the valley of love and delight.<a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>
    </p></blockquote>

    <p>
      I don't claim to offer spiritual guidance, but I
      will say simplicity in design is delightful. This
      site was designed to (mostly) communicate concepts
      via text. Each design decision was guided by this
      objective.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two people I greatly admire in the field of
      communication are Edward Tufte
      <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a> and Massimo Vignelli
      <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a>. The former, Edward
      Tufte, has written extensively about
      <em>Information Design</em>
      <a href="#ref_3">[4]</a>, the practice of
      presenting information in a way that fosters efficient
      and effective understanding. The structure of this
      site is guided by his observations regarding
      information transfer. Massimo Vignelli's work as a
      graphic designer should be instantly recognizable
      to anyone who has seen a subway map or a corporate
      logo in the last half of the 20th century. Later
      in life, Vignelli published a design manifesto
      which included a great deal of practical guidance.
      This site is greatly influenced by "The Vignelli
      Canon." <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      So, why is this site so plain? <strong><em>It is
      plain so it does not distract from the experience
      of reading text.</em></strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      The rest of this text describes individual
      decisions I made to produce a well-designed site.
    </p>
    </section>

    <section id="02_Page_Size">

      <h2>Page Size and Margins</h2>

      <p>
      If you read Vignelli's Canon, one of the first
      bits of concrete advice he gives is to think about
      how text is laid out on the page and to view the
      page as a grid of columns and rows. Free space
      should be added so the eye can easily comprehend
      the structure of the print. An example given is to
      break up an A4 sized page along three columns and
      six rows with ample gutters and margins. Blocks of
      text, headers and images are all to be aligned on
      this grid. (See page 36 of the Canon
      <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      There's a tension between the designer's intent
      and the reader's need. Often, the designer is
      attempting to make something "beautiful" while the
      reader is just trying to make sense of the page.
      We're on a re-sizable web page, not a fixed printed
      page, so we have a slightly different design
      problem than the one Vignelli was addressing.
      We <em>could</em> use a "two-thirds" width offset
      to one side, as Vignelli recommends, but I think
      that would seem idiosyncratic to web readers.      
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, I limited the maximum width of
      the text to a multiple of the font size. The
      larger you make the print, the wider the max
      width becomes. If you expand the width of the page,
      the text stops expanding at some point. This is
      to maintain ease of reading. Research on how much
      easier narrow columns of text are to read is a
      little inconsistent, but a study by Beymer, Russell
      and Orton <a href="#ref_6">[6]</a> seems to support
      the notion that narrow columns are better.</p>

    <p>
      I would like to say that I studied the research
      at length to find the optimal margin size, but
      that's not what happened. In a pique of
      practicality, I simply looked at various paperback
      books and made the columns on this site about the
      same size.
    </p></section>

    <section id="03_Typefaces">
      
      <h2>Typefaces</h2>

      <p>
        Vignelli's advice is to limit the number of
        typefaces. Vignelli recommends Garamond, Bodoni,
        Century Expanded and Helvetica. (See page 54 of
        the Canon <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>.) I opted for
        Times New Roman due to its ubiquity.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a site that has several code examples,
        and I thought about selecting a specific
        typeface for the monospace font family, but
        testing revealed popular browsers selected a
        specific monospace typeface that was good enough
        to not warrant extra effort. But get in contact
        if that's not your experience.
      </p></section>

    <section id="04_Justification">
      
      <h2>Justification</h2>

      <p>
        By default, all non-preformatted text blocks are
        fill-justified. This is a slight contrivance, but
        I prefer the look of it. I find ragged,
        non-justified edges slightly confusing to my eye.
        I believe this is a justifiable design decision
        since most of the content on this site is
        (somewhat) long form text. I have seen plenty
        of counter-examples, but they tend to use font
        sizes that are larger than what I use here and
        use slightly thinner columns than I want to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Related to justification is line height. I looked
        at the default line heights for Chrome, Safari
        and Firefox for their default Times New Roman
        typeface. The text looked slightly scrunched. I
        opened up the line height to 125% of the default
        and got a reasonably easy to read result. I hope
        you agree.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="05_Semantic">
      
      <h2>Semantic Concerns</h2>

      <p>
        This site has two major types of pages: context
        pages and content pages. The main index page
        (follow the "Meadhbh Hamrick's Web Site" link at
        the bottom of the page) is a good example of a
        context page. This page is an example of a
        content page.
      </p>

      <p>
        Content pages are intended to be as distraction
        free as possible. The <em>text</em> is what we're
        focusing on and anything that distracts you
        reading is de-emphasized. You'll notice I even
        relegate outbound links to a
        <strong>References</strong> section. Links are
        rendered in gray instead of the usual blue.
      </p>

      <p>
        Context pages are there to help the reader
        understand where they are on the site and the
        relationship between different pages and
        sections. Links on context pages are blue and
        aren't segregated into a separate section.
        There's an interesting paper by Tuch, et al.
        <a href="#ref_7">[7]</a> which talks about
        rationalizing aesthetic judgments for web pages.
        It's partially responsible for stylistic
        differences between context and content
        pages; worth reading if you're into this
        kind of thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each page has a simple, yet distinctive header.
        If you look at the source of this page, you'll
        see I use a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element
        instead of a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element. I
        hope this works better with accessibility
        technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each page also has a footer the reader can use
        to understand the context of the page: what
        section it exists in and when it was last
        modified.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Finally, I have as my inspiration, "The World's
        First Web Page" <a href="#ref_8">[8]</a>,
        originally hosted at CERN, but now available at
        w3.org as a historical artifact.
      </p>
      
    </section>

    <section id="06_Conclusion">

      <h2>Wrapping It All Up</h2>

      <p>
        There you have it. This site is designed to be
        easy to read and to not be complicated. I don't
        depend on too many web browser defaults because
        as often as not, they're sub-optimal for a text
        focused site.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've introduced a few semantic contrivances:
        context pages vs. content pages, for example.
        And I've tried to segregate outbound links in a
        reference section.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's designed to be a simple site, and I hope
        the design does not overshadow the content.
