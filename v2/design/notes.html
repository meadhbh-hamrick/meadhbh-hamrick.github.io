    <section id="00_Intro"> <p>
      After noting Rat Factor's Note system
      <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a> on Hacker News
      <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a> I realized that I also
      have a note taking system. Inspired by Mr. Factor's
      lead, I decided to document it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let me start by saying I'm not encouraging you to
      adopt my system. It works for me, but you're a
      different person with different requirements. I
      encourage you to read this page and see if there's
      anything you can use.
    </p>

    <p>
      I <i>do</i> encourage you to think about how you
      take notes. As a sophomore in college I adopted the
      Cornell System for Note-Taking
      <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a> and it helped greatly.
      Simple changes in the way you think about
      note-taking can notably improve the utility of your
      notes and meeting minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      While I keep telling myself I will adapt this
      system to a note-taking app, it it mostly useful
      for taking notes on pen and paper. You can use it
      with virtually any word processor or text editor
      that supports unicode.
    </p>

    <p>
      I use either a 4-colour ballpoint pen (like this one
      from BiC <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a>), a PILOT 0.38mm
      Juice Gel Ink Ballpoint Pen 12 Color set
      <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>, or a PILOT Disposable
      Fountain Pen 3 Color Set <a href="#ref_6">[6]</a>.
      My system does not require the use of coloured ink
      and you are under no obligation to use coloured ink
      in your note-taking system. Props to Mr. Factor
      (aka Dave Gauer) for recommending the PILOT 0.38mm
      Juice Gel Ink pen.

    <h2>Journal Entries</h2>
      
    <p>
      Let me start with Journal Entries since Meeting
      Minutes are simple extensions of the journal entry
      system.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of the journal entry system is to
      "get ideas out of my head" or "declutter my mind"
      as David Allen says <a href="#ref_7">[7]</a>. The
      reason I developed this system was to improve my
      ability to find details in notes I had written to
      myself. I use a Zettelkasten type system
      <a href="#ref_8">[8]</a> for writing notes about
      specific subjects, but my journals are a
      chronological record of random thoughts, important
      details and random things I need to get out of my
      head so I can get back to useful work.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b><i>Writing notes is easy. Finding notes you've
      written is hard.</i></b> My note taking system is
      intended to help find things you've written down.
      Each of the "callouts" in this document represents
      something I've needed to find in my notes, but
      couldn't. I have callouts for to-do items, open
      questions, important changes, agreements and random
      important things. You may want to add your own.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what does a journal entry look like? I write
      them down as a header with a line across the page,
      a date, some hash-tags and a blank space for a QR
      Code. I haven't started putting QR Codes in my
      journal, but have a fantasy I'll eventually do it.
      If I didn't carve out a small space for the QR Code
      I would go nuts thinking about how I'll obscure the
      notes when I do eventually put QR Code stickers in
      my journals.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is reasonable approximation of what my journal
      looks like:

          Sometimes a page has multiple entries. Who
          knew?
        </p>

        <p>
          Hell is other peoples' journals.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>
        
    <p>
      A few obvious things: First, it's in black ink. I
      like black ink. When I was in the marines, the only
      type of pens we had were black pens. Blue pens were
      for civilians. If you want to see a Marine admin
      clerk freak out, use a blue pen on an official
      form. But old habits die hard and I like black ink
      for notes so I can use blue, red, green (and
      sometimes purple) to make callouts easier to find.
    </p>

    <p>
      Secondly, I use planetary symbols after the dates
      to denote the day of the week. You should probably
      just put the first couple of letters of the day. If
      you want to use planetary symbols, these are the
      ones I use:      
    </p>

    <table style="padding-left: 1cm;">
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9737;</td>
        <td>Sunday</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9789;</td>
        <td>Monday</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9794;</td>
        <td>Tuesday</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9791;</td>
        <td>Wednesday</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9795;</td>
        <td>Thursday</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9792;</td>
        <td>Friday</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9796;</td>
        <td>Saturday</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Lastly, it's clear I like to indent lines /
      paragraphs in my journals. When I give an example
      of callouts below, it will be more obvious why I
      indent everything: I don't indent callouts, so
      they're much easier to see.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>About To-Do Items</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      One day I had to find a pair of to-do items in my
      journal. It turns out they were kind of hard to
      find. I realized they would be easier to find if I
      included an "icon" next to them. I originally used
      a triangle, but later changed to a box. When I
      completed a task, I went back and put a check-mark
      in the box. If the task was "overtaken by events"
      and would not be completed, I put an "X" through
      it. When I left the marines and could use blue pens
      again, I sometimes wrote to-do items in blue. My
      colour vision is good enough that blue stands out
      against the black of the normal text. That's not
      true for everyone; feel free to pick a different
      colour. Or no colour. It's up to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      After more trial and error, I figured out that
      padding around to-do items and no indentation makes
      them easier to spot. Here's an example of a
      journal page with to-do items:
    </p>

    <div class="page">
      <div class="content">
        <hr/>
        <div class="left">
          1990-08-02 <span style="line-height: 2pt; font-size: 24pt; position: relative; top: 3px;">&#9792;</span><br>
          #marines
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <br/>
          QR Code Goes Here (Someday)
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Wondering if I'm going to get called up out
          of the IRR.
        </p>
        
        <p class="callout todo">
          &#9745; Call Kansas City and ask if my DD-214 was mailed
          out.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe I should try to find my gear in case they
          call me back or I have to prove I still have
          it.
        </p>
        
        <p class="callout todo">
          &#9745; Get gear out of storage.
        </p>

        <p class="callout todo">
          &#9746; Inventory gear. Is it all there?
        </p>
        
      </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <hr/>
        <div class="left">
          1990-08-06 <span style="line-height: 2pt; font-size: 24pt; position: relative; top: 3px;">&#9789;</span><br>
          #marines
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <br/>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Called Kansas City, they said the DD-214 was
          mailed out last Thursday.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      From this example, I can see that I listed several
      to-do items. The first two I completed, but the
      last one was abandoned, likely because I felt it
      was unlikely I would be called out of the
      Individual Ready Reserve after talking with the
      DoD Finance Office in Kansas City.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>When Things Change</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes things change. Important changes get a
      red exclamation point. Consider this example:
    </p>

    <div class="page">
      <div class="content">
        <hr/>
        <div class="left">
          1987-06-01 <span style="line-height: 2pt; font-size: 24pt; position: relative; top: 3px;">&#9789;</span><br>
          #marines #reserve
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <br/>
          QR Code Goes Here (Someday)
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          SgtMaj Havens says there's no way I'm going to
          A-School this summer; it's okay to register for
          summer classes.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <hr/>
        <div class="left">
          1987-06-12 <span style="line-height: 2pt; font-size: 24pt; position: relative; top: 3px;">&#9792;</span><br>
          #marines
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <br/>
          QR Code Goes Here (Someday)
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="callout change">
          <b>!</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;SgtMaj Havens called to say
          he has orders for me to go to my A-School at
          LeJeune.
        </p>

        <p>
          Called registrar, I can drop Psych class as
          incomplete-passing and finish it next fall.
        </p>

        <p class="callout todo">
          &#9745; <b>(1987-06-14)</b> Get a note from MAG-41 to housing

          without penalty.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      In this example we can see that Sergeant Major
      Havens had "incomplete information" about my second
      increment of Initial Active Duty for Training
      Purposes. That I had to drop my Psych class in the
      summer of '87 and report to Camp LeJeune for
      training was an important change, so it got a
      red exclamation point. We can also see that I had
      to get a note from my reserve unit to give to the
      university housing office saying I was being
      activated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another thing to note: when to-do items have a due
      date, I insert the date between the box and the
      description.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Random Important Things</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes I realize something is important after
      writing it down. In this case I put a purple dot
      in the margin. If I don't have a purple pen on me,
      I'll put a blue dot in the margin. Here's an
      example:
    </p>

    <div class="page">
      <div class="content">
        <hr/>
        <div class="left">
          2022-01-07 <span style="line-height: 2pt; font-size: 24pt; position: relative; top: 3px;">&#9792;</span><br>
          #car #maintenance
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <br/>
          QR Code Goes Here (Someday)
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          I'm pretty sure I don't need to pull
          maintenance on the Fiat before my trip to the
          bay area.
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          <span style="color:purple;">&#11044;</span>&#8201;More likely I'll just call the
          mechanic at (831) 555-1212 and schedule an oil
          change while I'm down there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seems like I'm about 1000 miles shy of when I
          need an oil change and I bet they can figure
          out what air filters I need.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      What happened here is I wrote down the phone number
      for a mechanic a friend recommended and later
      realized it might be a good idea to be able to find
      that number later. This isn't a major change or a
      to-do item, so I just put a purple dot next to it.
    </p>

    <a name="02_Meeting_Minutes"></a>
    <section id="02_Meeting_Minutes">
    <h2>Meeting Minutes</h2>

    <p>
      I used to use the Cornell Note-Taking System
      <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a> for meeting notes, but
      eventually determined it wasn't the right tool for
      the job. After a while, my meeting minutes started
      looking like my journal entries. I don't care about
      QR Codes for meeting notes. I'm not entirely sure
      why.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meeting minutes still have a date and hash-tags in
      the header, but also a list of attendees.
    </p>

    <p>
      Callouts for meeting minutes include "open
      questions" and "agreements". And I still use
      to-dos, major changes and purple dots.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Open Question" callouts are just what you would
      expect: a question that hasn't been answered. I
      write them in blue ink and preface them with a big
      question mark. Like to-do callouts, if there's a
      due date, I insert it between the question mark and
      the text of the question.
    </p>

    <p>
      "General Agreement" callouts are notes that the
      meeting attendees agreed to something. It is often
      important to be able to find records of such
      agreements quickly. I use a green star for
      agreements. I wanted to use a thumbs up sign, but
      was told that might be an offensive gesture in some
      cultures. I originally used shaking hands as the
      "agreement" icon, but most people who saw it said
      it looked like a raccoon.
    </p>

      Here's an example of what my meeting minutes might
      look like:

      In the meeting we minuted here, there was general
      agreement when the login-service cut-over would
      take place. But there's still an outstanding
      question as to whether we need to get this plan
      approved by IT and a to-do item to find out what
      ticket category IT wants us to use.

    <h2>Field Notes</h2>

    <p>
      In my system, "Field Notes" are anything that gets
      written in a small 3.7" x 5.6" (small) notebook.
      For me, that's mostly passwords and shopping lists.
      I should probably mention "Field Notes" is a
      trademarked term; I usually use it in a generic
      sense, but the people who make the Field Notes
      &reg; note books would probably prefer I use the
      registered trademark symbol when talking about
      their brand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dave Gauer (aka Rat Factor) recommends thin Field
      Notes &reg; books <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>. I
      prefer PAPERAGE small notebooks
      <a href="#ref_9">[9]</a>. They're <i>almost</i> as
      easy to lay-flat as the Field Notes &reg; brand
      and have a harder cover and include an elastic band
      to secure them while they're in your pocket or
      backpack. Field Notes &reg; notepads are even
      easier to lay flat and come in a variety of colours
      and designs. There is no shame in preferring Field
      Notes &reg; to PAPERAGE.
    </p>

    <p>
      A typical entry for me would look like:
    </p>

    <div class="page">
      <div class="content">
        <div class="left">
          2022-02-25 <span style="line-height: 2pt; font-size: 24pt; position: relative; top: 3px;">&#9792;</span><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          <b>-</b> Drop off taxes at the post office
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>-</b> Meals: Veggie Chili, Tofu Thai Curry
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>-</b> List:<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Paper Towels<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Fresh Thai Basil<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Green Pepper<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Zucchini or Japanese Eggplant<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Firm Tofu<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Lime Leaves<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Small Mushrooms<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> TVP<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Eggs<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Bread<br/>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      From this you can probably guess I don't bother
      with callouts on field notes and I eat mostly
      veggies. With small notebooks, my notes usually
      take up the whole page so I often ignore lines and
      almost never include hash-marks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of these small notebooks for me is to
      record thoughts when I'm out of the house / office
      and to write things down I know I'll need when I'm
      out. I have a habit of looking at my small
      notebooks twice a week and when I'm about to walk
      out the door. (In the example above, I wrote a note
      to remind myself to grab my taxes if I'm driving
      anywhere near a post office.)

        alt="A small notepad with passwords in it"
        src="../../img/2022-02-26-600x695_passnote.png"/>
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a different small notebook which contains
      passwords. This one usually never leaves the house.
      I scribble usernames and passwords on POST-IT &reg;
      page markers <a href="#ref_10">[10]</a> and then
      place them in the small notebook. When I change
      the password, I take the old page marker out and
      put in a new one. You may also notice I put a line
      above capital letters and a line below lower case
      letters.

      <h2>A Pen of a Different Colour</h2>

      <p>
        Some people will tell you not to make colour
        semantically important because many people are
        colour blind. And that's very good advice. But my
        colour vision is pretty good, and this is a
        description of my personal note-taking system.
      </p>

      <p>
        That being said, I've noticed my eye-sight
        deteriorate over the years and can envision a
        time in the future where I lose colour
        perception. So I made sure that everywhere colour
        is used, there's also a unique "icon". It will
        be harder to find things if I lose my colour
        vision, but not impossible.
      </p>

      <p>
        I use a number of different writing implements.
        I use felt-tip pens and coloured pencils when
        designing things. I use fountain pens when
        writing notes to people. In my journal,
        I currently use several PILOT Juice Gel Ink pens
        <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>. But for scribbling in
        small notebooks, I use a BiC 4 Color pen
        <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a>.
