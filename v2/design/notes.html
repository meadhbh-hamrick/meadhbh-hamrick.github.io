    <section id="00_Intro"> <p>
      After noticing Rat Factor's note system
      <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a> on Hacker News
      <a href="#ref_2">[2]</a> I started thinking about
      how I take notes. Inspired by Mr. Factor's article,
      I decided to document my own system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let me start by saying I'm not encouraging you to
      adopt my system. It works for me, but you're a
      different person with different requirements. I
      encourage you to read this page and see if there's
      anything you can use, but I will not be offended if
      you decide to pass on my system.
    </p>

    <p>
      I <i>do</i> encourage you to think about how you
      take notes. As a sophomore in college I adopted the
      Cornell System for Note-Taking
      <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a> and it helped greatly.
      Simple changes in the way you think about
      note-taking can notably improve the utility of your
      notes.
    </p>

    <p>
      While I keep telling myself I will adapt this
      system to a note-taking app, it is really for
      taking notes on pen and paper. You can use it with
      virtually any word processor or text editor, but
      pen and paper is where  this system has the most
      utility.
    </p>

    <p>
      My system does not require the use of coloured ink
      and you are under no obligation to use coloured ink
      if you adopt this system. But if your colour
      perception is decent, it can help to highlight
      things you're trying to find with different colour
      inks. I use either a 4-colour ballpoint pen (like
      this one from BiC <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a>), a
      PILOT 0.38mm Juice Gel Ink Ballpoint Pen 12 Color
      set <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>, or a PILOT Disposable
      Fountain Pen 3 Color Set <a href="#ref_6">[6]</a>.
      Props to Mr. Factor (aka Dave Gauer) for
      recommending the PILOT 0.38mm Juice Gel Ink pen.
    </p>

    <section id="01_Journal_Entries">
    <h2>Journal Entries</h2>

    <p>
      The purpose of the journal entry system is, as
      David Allen says <a href="#ref_7">[7]</a>, to "get
      ideas out of my head." The reason I developed this
      system was to improve my ability to find details in
      notes I had written to myself in journals. I use a
      Zettelkasten type system <a href="#ref_8">[8]</a>
      when writing notes about specific subjects, but my
      journals are a chronological record of random
      thoughts and important details. I need to get these
      things out of my head so I can get back to useful
      work, but I eventually need to find the notes I
      write down.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b><i>Writing notes is easy. Finding notes you've
      written is hard.</i></b> My note taking system is
      intended to help find things I've written down.
      I use "callouts" to highlight different types of
      specific details so they're easier to find. I have
      callouts for to-do items, open questions, important
      changes, agreements and random important things.
      You may want to add your own.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what does a journal entry look like? I write
      them down as a header with a line across the page,
      a date, some hash-tags and a blank space for a QR
      Code. I haven't started putting QR Codes in my
      journal, but have a fantasy I'll eventually do it.
      If I didn't carve out a small space for the QR Code
      I would go nuts thinking about how I'll obscure
      small portions of my notes when I do eventually put
      QR Code stickers in my journals.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is reasonable approximation of what my journal
      looks like:

    </div>
        
    <p>
      A few obvious things: First, it's in black ink. I
      like black ink. When I was in the Marines, the only
      type of pens we had were black pens. Blue pens were
      for civilians. If you want to see a Marine admin
      clerk freak out, use a blue pen on an official
      form. I'm used to black ink now and if most of the
      text is black, then the blue, red, green (and
      sometimes purple) callouts are easier to find.
    </p>

    <p>
      I use planetary symbols after the dates to denote
      the day of the week. You should probably just put
      the first couple of letters of the day, it's
      easier. But I've been using planetary symbols for
      more than half my life. Not using them seems weird.
      If you want to use planetary symbols to represent
      the days of the week, these are the ones I use:
    </p>

    <table style="padding-left: 1cm;">
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9737;</td>
        <td>Sunday</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9789;</td>
        <td>Monday</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9794;</td>
        <td>Tuesday</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9791;</td>
        <td>Wednesday</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9795;</td>
        <td>Thursday</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9792;</td>
        <td>Friday</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="2cm">&#9796;</td>
        <td>Saturday</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Lastly, it's clear I like margins. They're a great
      place to scribble small notes. I also put callout
      "icons" in the margin, which makes them <i>much</i>
      easier to find.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>About To-Do Items</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      One day I had to find a pair of to-do items in my
      journal. I found them, of course, but I realized it
      would have been much easier had I included an
      "icon" next to them; a graphical symbol
      representing the concept of a to-do item. After
      several icons, I settled on a box. When I completed
      a task, I went back and put a check-mark in the
      box. If the task was "overtaken by events" and
      would not be completed, I put an "X" through
      it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When I left the marines and could use blue pens
      again, I wrote to-do items in blue. My colour
      vision is good enough that blue stands out next to
      the black of "normal" text. That's not true for
      everyone; feel free to pick a different colour. Or
      no colour. Here's an example of a journal page with
      to-do items:
    </p>

    <div class="page">
      <div class="content">
        <hr/>
        <div class="left">

        <div class="right">

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Wondering if I'm going to get called up out
          of the reserves.

        <p class="callout todo">

          out.
        </p>

          Maybe I should try to find my gear in case they
          call me back or I have to prove I still have
          it.
        </p>
        
        <p class="callout todo">
          &#9745; Get gear out of storage.
        </p>

        <p class="callout todo">
          &#9746; Inventory gear. Is it all there?
        </p>
        
      </div>
      
      <div class="content">
        <hr/>
        <div class="left">

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Called Kansas City, they said the DD-214 was
          mailed out last Thursday.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      From this example, I can see that I listed several
      to-do items. The first two I completed, but the
      last one was abandoned.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>When Things Change</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes things change. Important changes get a
      red exclamation point. Consider this example:
    </p>

    <div class="page">
      <div class="content">
        <hr/>
        <div class="left">

      </div>
      <div class="content">

          SgtMaj Havens says there's no way I'm going to

          summer classes.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="content">

        <div class="right">

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="callout change">
          <b>!</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;SgtMaj Havens called to say
          he has orders for me to go to my A-School at

        </p>

        <p>
          Called registrar, I can drop Psych class as
          incomplete-passing and finish it next fall.
        </p>

          without penalty.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      In this example we can see Sergeant Major Havens
      had "incomplete information" about my second
      increment of Initial Active Duty for Training
      Purposes. That I had to drop my Psych class in the
      summer of '87 and report to Camp LeJeune for
      training was an important change, so it got a red
      exclamation point.
    </p>

    <p>
      When to-do items have a due date, I insert the
      date between the box and the text of the callout.
      In this example, we can see I had a deadline for
      getting a note about my deployment from the MAG-41
      admin office.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Random Things</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      I ocassionally realize something is important after
      writing it down. In this case I put a purple dot
      in the margin. If I don't have a purple pen on me,
      I'll put a blue dot in the margin. Here's an
      example:
    </p>

    <div class="page">
      <div class="content">
        <hr/>
        <div class="left">
          2022-01-07 <span style="line-height: 2pt; font-size: 24pt; position: relative; top: 3px;">&#9792;</span><br>
          #car #maintenance
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <br/>
          QR Code Goes Here (Someday)
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          I'm pretty sure I don't need to pull
          maintenance on the Fiat before my trip to the
          bay area.
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          <span style="color:purple;">&#11044;</span>&#8201;More likely I'll just call the
          mechanic at (831) 555-1212 and schedule an oil
          change while I'm down there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seems like I'm about 1000 miles shy of when I
          need an oil change and I bet they can figure
          out what air filters I need.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      In this example I wrote down the phone number for a
      mechanic. Later I realized I wanted to highlight it
      so it would be easier to find. This isn't a major
      change, or a to-do item, so I just put a purple dot
      next to it.

    <section id="02_Meeting_Minutes">
    <h2>Meeting Minutes</h2>

    <p>
      I used to use the Cornell Note-Taking System
      <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a> for meeting notes, but
      soon realized it wasn't the correct tool for the
      job. The Cornell system is great for taking notes
      in class, but meeting minutes? Not so much.
      After reverting to a free-form style, my meeting
      minutes started looking like my journal entries,
      though I don't try to wedge QR Codes into meeting
      minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meeting minutes still have a date and hash-tags in
      the header, and also a list of attendees.
    </p>

    <p>
      Callouts for meeting minutes include "open
      questions" and "agreements". And I still use
      to-dos, major changes and purple dots.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Open Question" callouts are just what you would
      expect: a question that hasn't been answered. I
      write them in blue ink and preface them with a big
      question mark. Like to-do callouts, open questings
      with a due date get that date inserted between the
      question mark icon and the text of the question.
    </p>

    <p>
      "General Agreement" callouts indicate the meeting
      attendees agreed to something. It is often
      important to be able to find records of such
      agreements quickly. I use a green star for
      agreements. I wanted to use a thumbs up sign or
      shaking hands icons, but stars are considerably
      easier to draw.
    </p>

      Here's an example of what my meeting minutes might

          Alice described the DNS cut-over technique
          we'll use

          Sriram verified we won't need any code changes.

      In the meeting minuted here, there was general
      agreement when the login-service cut-over would
      occur, but we're still not sure we need to get the
      plan approved by IT. And there's a to-do item to
      find out what category IT wants us to use for our
      JIRA tickets.

    <h2>On The Go</h2>

    <p>
      I'm usually at home or in the office when writing
      meeting notes or journal entries. I usually use B6
      or A4 sized notebooks or notepads for these kinds
      of notes. (That's approximately letter size or 5"
      by 8" size in the ANSI paper scheme.) But when I'm
      on the go, I have different requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      When out and about, I need a portable notepad
      
    <p>
      In my system, "Field Notes" are anything that gets
      written in a 3.7" x 5.6" (small) notebook. For me,
      that's mostly passwords and shopping lists. I
      should mention "Field Notes" is a trademarked term;
      I usually use it in a generic sense, but the people
      who make Field Notes &reg; note books probably prefer
      I use the registered trademark symbol when talking
      about their brand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dave Gauer (aka Rat Factor) recommends thin Field
      Notes &reg; books <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>. I
      prefer PAPERAGE small notebooks
      <a href="#ref_9">[9]</a>. They're <i>almost</i> as
      easy to lay-flat as the Field Notes &reg; brand
      and have a harder cover and include an elastic band
      to secure them while they're in your pocket or
      backpack. Field Notes &reg; notepads are easier to
      lay flat and come in a variety of colours and
      designs. There is no shame in preferring Field
      Notes &reg; to PAPERAGE.
    </p>

    <p>
      A typical entry for me would look like:
    </p>

    <div class="page">
      <div class="content">
        <div class="left">
          2022-02-25 <span style="line-height: 2pt; font-size: 24pt; position: relative; top: 3px;">&#9792;</span><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          <b>-</b> Drop off taxes at the post office
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>-</b> Meals: Veggie Chili, Tofu Thai Curry
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>-</b> List:<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Paper Towels<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Fresh Thai Basil<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Green Pepper<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Zucchini or Japanese Eggplant<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Firm Tofu<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Lime Leaves<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Small Mushrooms<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> TVP<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Eggs<br/>
          &nbsp;<b>-</b> Bread<br/>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      From this you can probably guess I don't bother
      with callouts on field notes and I eat mostly
      veggies. My notes often take up the whole page so
      it's rare to see lines separating different notes
      and I almost never include hash-marks.
    </p>

    <p>
      I use small notebooks to record thoughts when I'm
      out of the house / office and to write things down
      I know I'll need when I'm out. I have a habit of
      looking at my small notebooks as I'm about to walk
      out the door or twice a week. (In the example
      above, I wrote a note to remind myself to grab my
      taxes if I'm driving anywhere near a post office.)
    </p>

    <p>
      <img
        alt="A small notepad with passwords in it"
        src="../../img/2022-02-26-600x695_passnote.png"/>
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a different small notebook which contains
      passwords. This one usually never leaves the house.
      I scribble usernames and passwords on POST-IT &reg;
      page markers <a href="#ref_10">[10]</a> and then
      place them in the small notebook. When I change
      the password, I take the old page marker out and
      put in a new one. You may also notice I put a line
      above capital letters and a line below lower case
      letters.

      <h2>A Pen of a Different Colour</h2>

      <p>
        Some people will tell you not to make colour
        semantically important because many people are
        colour blind. And that's very good advice. But my
        colour vision is pretty good, and this is a
        description of my personal note-taking system.
      </p>

      <p>
        That being said, I've noticed my eye-sight
        deteriorate over the years and can envision a
        time in the future where I lose colour
        perception. So I made sure that everywhere colour
        is used, there's also a unique "icon". It will
        be harder to find things if I lose my colour
        vision, but not impossible.
      </p>

      <p>
        I use a number of different writing implements.
        I use felt-tip pens and coloured pencils when
        designing things. I use fountain pens when
        writing notes to people. In my journal,
        I currently use several PILOT Juice Gel Ink pens
        <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>. But for scribbling in
        small notebooks, I use a BiC 4 Color pen
        <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a>.
