    <title>Alto Article Irony</title>

    <section>
      
      <p>
        So I was reading this article by David Brock on the
        IEEE page about the Xerox Alto <a href="#ref_1">[1]</a>
        and it dawned on me: I'm reading an article about
        <i>the</i> machine that introduced the concepts of
        graphical user interfaces in a terminal window.
      </p>

      <p>

      </p>

      <p>
        I dunno.  I just appreciate the irony.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was going to include Gibson's quote about how evenly
        the future is distributed, but I'm going to point to
        <a href="#ref_2">Igor Schwarzmann's commentary on
          it</a> instead.  The future looks uneven if you
        assume external agency prevents you from upgrading to
        the latest and greatest.
      </p>

      <p>

        Schwarzmann puts it better than I could when he
        observes:
      </p>

      <blockquote>

        "The more we rely on this quote as a mantra, the
        more we relinquish our own agency. It puts us all
        into the position of living in a future that
        belongs to someone else and never our own."
          
      </blockquote>

      <p>

        We wring our hands when we discover decades old
        computers play an integral part in our nuclear
        deterrent <a href="#ref_3">[3]</a>.  Most younger
        software engineers are amazed to discover the Computer
        Command System (CCS) controlling the Voyager probes is
        a custom 18-bit system with 4k words of memory (9k
        bytes) <a href="#ref_4">[4]</a>.
        
      </p>

      <p>

        "How can you do anything in 9 kilobytes?" they ask.
        
      </p>

      <p>

        I usually reply that when all you have is 9kb, you make
        do.  But there's a deeper truth at work: <i>the past
        has utility.</i>  Novelty is important, but novelty for
        novelty's sake is, as Schwarzmann implies above,
        dancing to someone else's tune.

      </p>

      <p>

        If you look closely at the image above, you can see
        there's a title-bar on the terminal window.  Of course
        I use a windowing system.  It let's me manage the
        multiple terminal windows I have open on a typical day.

      </p>

      <p>

        "What You See is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) is an
        important concept for environments where you are
        manipulating abstract objects whose nature is
        positional <a href="#ref_5">[5]</a>.  You can move a
        window or icon around a screen with a mouse.  That
        makes sense.  Do you need to move a page of text around
        when reading a book?  Probably not.  (Writing or
        composing a book is a completely different matter.)
        
      </p>

      <p>

        The term "What You See Is All You Get (WYSIAYG)"
        describes the opportunity cost of using a graphical
        environment when something else would do better
        <a href="#ref_6">[6]</a>.  It didn't take me long do
        learn how to use the *nix command line and I feel it
        gives me much finer grained control over my digital
        assets.
        
      </p>

      <p>

        I'm not a barbarian.  I don't watch HBO on cable TV.  I
        have a device that plugs into my TV for that.  And I
        sometimes use a graphical file browser to move files
        around instead of the venerable <code>mv</code> and
        <code>cp</code> commands.

      </p>

      <p>

        But just about every time I view content in a typical
        web browser, it's clear I'm not the customer.  My
        eyeballs have been sold to some advertiser.  I would
        not have a problem with this but for the auto-play
        video ads and the blinking images.

      </p>

      <p>

        "But this is the price of free content," you say.  No,
        I pay over $1000 a year for various subscriptions:
        Financial Times, HBR, Washington Post.  I believe my
        payment gives me <i>some</i> consideration regarding
        the nature of ads I see on that platform.  I never
        encountered an ad in print media that gave me a
        seizure.  I would like to say the same about blinky
        video ads on the web.

      </p>
      
      <p>

        The terminal gives me some manner of control.  When I
        view the web from EWW (Emacs' Web Browser
        <a href="#ref_7">[7]</a>) or Lynx (another popular
        text-based web browser <a href="#ref_8">[8]</a>), I am
        seeing the textual content <b>*I*</b> want to see.
        With a few key-strokes I can render a web-page in
        Firefox if I need to see images on the page.

      </p>

      <p>
        
        And living in the terminal gives me a degree of agility
        in terms of identity.  When I ssh to work or personal
        systems, my identity lands only on those systems (and
        maybe a few routers in-between.)  I leave way fewer
        crumbs for the advertisers to follow.

      </p>
      
      <p>

        Text is nice.  Text is pleasant.  Text doesn't reach
        out and bite you.  And I guarantee you I see a lot
        fewer ads than you do.
