        me: "and then you just download the javascript app
        into your browser"
      </p>

      <p>
        them: "download? from a BBS?"
      </p>

      <p>
        me: "from a web page. it's like a BBS, only with
        more graphics and not all of them have forums."
      </p>

      <p>
        them: "EVERY time you want to run a program, you
        download it from the web page BBS?"
      </p>

      <p>
        me: "yep."
      </p>

      <p>
        them: "that doesn't sound very nice. did you not
        have enough money to buy a floppy drive?"
      </p>

      <p>
        me: "lol. no. we all use FLASH memory now."
      </p>

      <p>
        them: "then why don't you load programs from flash
        memory, if it's like a floppy disk?"
      </p>

      <p>
        me: "we download it every time to get the most
        recent version of the code"
      </p>

      <p>
        them: "holy crap! how many times do you upgrade
        your programs?"
      </p>

      <p>
        me: "they're constantly being upgraded. facebook
        supposedly pushes out a few new minor revs each
        day"
      </p>

      <p>
        them: "why don't they just wait 'til their programs
        are done before releasing them?"
      </p>

      <p>
        me: "oh. browser vendors make changes on a near
        weekly basis, so you have to tweak your program to
        make it work with new browser features."
      </p>

      <p>
        them: "have you considered firebombing the offices
        of these browser vendors?"
      </p>

      <p>
        me: "more often than I would like to admit."
      </p>

      <p>
        them: "that was a joke, right?"
      </p>

      <p>
        me: "oh. sure. just joking. they have worse
        punishments than firebombing. they have to go to
        google I/O every year."
