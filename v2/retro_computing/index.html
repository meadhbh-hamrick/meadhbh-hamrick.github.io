        Once, everything was new. You woke up one day
        thinking you knew how the world worked and
        somewhere along the way something happened that
        changed everything. In the late 1970s and early
        1980s, this happened a lot for computer
        enthusiasts. Things were changing so fast no one
        knew what was supposed to be normal; no one knew
        who was going to make the next, great
        thing. Everyone had a more or less equal chance to
        build something that would change the world or make
        a million dollars (this is back when a million
        dollars was a lot of money.) Surplus parts from the
        defense industry started spilling over into
        academic and commercial worlds a decade before. Big
        business already understood the benefits of
        computing, but viewed information processing merely
        as an extension of accounting and financial
        controls.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the home computer revolutionaries of the late
        1970s injected a spirit of playfulness into the
        market. The best product developers of the era not
        only approached engineering problems from a
        rational perspective, they sought to become artists
        and achieve an intuitive understanding of their new
        medium. Micro-computers from this era weren't only
        interesting for the new applications they made
        possible; they were downright fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's what I see when I look at these old
        systems. They're not just old junk, they are (or
        were) the living embodiment of modern playful
        novelty. There was no time to get bored because
        every month a new system would be released or a new
        type of peripheral or a new type of computer
        program (or an old, expensive peripheral would
        become affordable.) There was a time before the
        first spread-sheet and before the first computer
        joystick. There was a time, not too long ago, when
        computers didn't have video displays (much less
        touchscreens, mice or wi-fi.) There was a time when
        text adventure games were new and 9600 baud modems
        were fast.
      </p>

      <p>
        And retro-computing is about more than just
        hardware, it's also about user experience. There
        were no rules in the old days; no one said you had
        to have an app store for your Atari 2600. No one
        said you had to run a virus scan on your TI-99/4A
        cartridges.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Commodore 64 booted into a BASIC interpreter in
        about five seconds; modern systems take at least
        twice that at least. When I want to type out some
        notes, I still reach for my TRS-80 Model 102. It
        goes from "off" to "typing" in about four
        seconds. There's also no username / password screen
        to navigate past and I don't have to wait for the
        text editor to load. You just turn it on and start
        typing.
      </p>

        The Canon Cat introduced a world that could have
        been. Everything you do today with a mouse,
        trackpad or touchscreen today, the Canon Cat did
        with a keyboard. You never move your fingers from
        their resting position on the keys. Even stranger,
        it's primary abstraction was a typed document. You
        didn't use menus to navigate through applications;
        you typed out a few commands, selected them and
        told the system to execute them; that's how you
        launched new applications, by typing "run terminal
        program" or "enable forth interpreter."

        And now a small story. In 1990, I worked for a
        company called PCSG (Personal Computer Support
        Group.) At the time I viewed management there as
        myopic, but they were probably living under greater
        constraints than I was aware of. This is a brief
        narrative I wrote to try to make sense of what we
        probably should have known at the time: <a href="talking_with_michael.html">Talking

        Here is the description of a project I undertook to

        the mid-80s: <a href="the_discovery_web_desktop.html">The

        It's easy to get nostalgic for the old
        days. Individual programmers are considerably more
        productive now than they were in the days when you
        had to use 6502 or 8086 assembly to get decent
        performance out of a machine. However, there was a
        strange joy in programming "close to the metal." If
        you're interested in reliving the glory days of
        MS-DOS development, I have some links to various
        references on the <a href="some_old_software_from_the_dos_days.html">Some
        Old Software from the DOS Days</a> page.

        And for fans of interactive fiction, I wrote a
        brief article about rolling your own adventure game

      <h2>Things that Look Like Essays</h2>

      <p>
        What's life without a few essays to prove you can
        string sentences together? In this first essay I
        argue that modern programmers are pale imitations
        of the coders of yore. The types of programs we
        write today are, I suppose, radically different. Or
        at least the user interfaces are different. If
        you're building something with a UI, you have to
        consult with specialists to ensure it's accessible
        and exports the appropriate abstraction. But in the
        old days, we didn't care about such optimizations
        because <a href="software_giants_walked_the_earth.html">Software
        Giants Walked the Earth</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's also possible we have too much software
        chasing too small a problem domain. Do we turn to
        software inappropriately to solve problems that
        shouldn't be solved? With respect to software,

        much is too much?</a>

        For many of us who grew up in the '70s and '80s,
        our first personal computers were under-powered
        beasts, barely capable of running a decent PacMan
        clone. But the most interesting part of early home
        computers was the assumption that the end user
        would write their own programs to solve their own
        problems instead of purchasing off-the-shelf
        software written by someone else. Even after the
        IBM PC was released, it was still common for home
        computers to "Boot to BASIC." There are few
        programming languages maligned with such regularity
        as Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code
        (BASIC), but it's not without it's charms (or it's
        utility.) Compared to modern languages like C++ or
        JavaScript, BASIC seems ill-conceived and incapable
        of tackling modern information problems. But in
        it's day, it was exactly what the industry
        needed. People have forgotten (or never knew) what
        it was like back in the day, so I wrote this short
        essay <a href="in_defense_of_basic.html">In Defense
        of BASIC</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another aspect of old computers is their
        single-taskedness. Old machines were so
        under-powered, it seemed superfluous to ask them to
        do multiple tasks when they could hardly do a
        single task well. But now fast forward 35 years and
        respectable operating systems like Windows and
        MacOS-X allow applications to take over the whole
        screen, as if the user were interested in only a
        single task. Modern machines are more than capable
        of doing multiple things simultaneously, but it
        reminds me of <a href="the_joy_of_single_tasking.html">The
        Joy of Single-Tasking</a>.

        I was recently reading an article about the
        Xerox Alto, one of, if not the first computer
        systems to integrate graphical interfaces and
        computer networking.  And then I noticed I was
        reading the article in the spiritual successor
        of the teletype.  This got me thinking about old
        technology and I wrote this article:

          Irony</a>.
