        In the middle of making the UI for an embedded
        thingamabob that pretends to be a nuclear power
        plant control pane (of course I'm making a
        Web-based UI) and was thinkingâ€¦ Why not re-use the
        Disco Interface?

        Disco is an HTML homage to old Macintoshes I cooked
        up a couple years ago; mostly to prove it could be
        done, but also to serve as the user interface for a
        different product. I'm just curious though... is
        this the kind of thing that would make you run
        screaming?

        Disco started with a few UI mockups I threw
        together, trying to demonstrate concepts for
        desktop applications. It turned out I knew HTML +
        CSS + JavaScript much better than I knew how to
        throw together a decent desktop application.

        Disco is free as in beer software, though it's not
        supported. Some day I'll make a successor to
        Disco. In the mean-you're certainly welcome to fork
        it and do something interesting with it. You can
        find the code at <a href="https://github.com/OhMeadhbh/disco">https://github.com/OhMeadhbh/disco</a>.
