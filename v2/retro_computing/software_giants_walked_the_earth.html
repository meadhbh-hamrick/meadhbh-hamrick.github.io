    <title>In the Days of Old, Software Giants Walked the Earth</title>

    <section>
      
      <p>
        Gather around the virtual campfire, young software
        engineers and hear the tale of the coders of
        yore. We do not know why the world changed, but the
        order of agile product managers tells us it started
        with the forging of the great three ring binders of
        power. Three were given to the military industrial
        complex, the fairest of the elder patrons with the
        patience to fund research projects. Five were given
        to the telephony firms, digging in the earth for
        relevance in a networked world. Nine binders of
        power were given to Industry, who above all else
        crave EPS growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Contained within the three ring binders was the
        will to control the product development
        life-cycle. But they were all of them deceived; the
        dark lord forged another binder in secret. Bound to
        the one three ring binder was the power to wield
        the freemium business model.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>"One Ringtone to rule them all. One network to
          find them, One platform to bring them all, and to
          the service contract bind them."</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        In the lands of dot com a great battle waged for
        the soul of consumer culture. A vast alliance of
        salesmen and open source hackers made war against
        the regressive forces of crappy software products
        and proprietary networks. In the darkest night when
        IBM appeared to consume the soul of the once great
        Apple, Lord Steve of Cupertino emerged to defeat
        the dark lord of business process.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Think Different," was his battle cry. A great
        victory was won under his banner, and Lord Steve
        had one chance to cast the binder of power into the
        silicon foundries of doom and destroy its power
        forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this is not his story. This is the story of the
        most unassuming creature of all: the early 1980s
        Independent Software Vendor (ISV.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Before the Ancient and Justified Book of Face or
        the Great Numbered One, Sovereign of Mountain View,
        software warriors rode 8-bit micros into
        battle. Against the forces of chaos and evil, great
        coders of old wielded the powerful but primitive
        weapons: the front panel, the assembler and the
        text editor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Great armies of young squires carried BASIC
        interpreters into the field. Many were cut down in
        the great Consumer Software Revolt of the early
        '80s; a few survived, defending their business
        processes with VisiCalc, Lotus and Excel. A select
        few continued the direct assault with the tools of
        the great Borland Weapon-Smiths.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before the great networking when cowboys cruised
        cyberspace with 56k modems, bands of adventurers
        sought fortune in the data processing
        marketplace. Before we thought of computers as
        communication stones, we wove complicated "decision
        support" spells; our mountain cousins concerned
        themselves with "industrial control" incantations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The spells of the great programmers of yore were
        simple, but direct. Written in arcane and ancient
        dialects, few mastered their true power. Their
        patrons were the merchant princes of Osgiliath and
        Bree and Dallas. Many code wizards lived a solitary
        existence, seeking mastery of their craft. When
        they worked with others, they worked closely with a
        salesman (a master of relieving people of their
        money), a product manager (who battled the forces
        of chaos with the sword of clarity) and a system
        administrator (the cleric whose prayers turned the
        hard disk platters.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Adventurers would move from opportunity to
        opportunity, deftly building value for their
        customers. Designs would be proposed, markets
        evaluated and leads qualified. The ISVs of old
        developed products whose value was manifold and
        apparent; the great merchant princes found value in
        them and paid handsomely for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the dark one spread discord among the merchant
        princes, singing the sweet song of quarterly
        earnings growth through the freemium business
        model. "We will monetize our synergy..." the song
        went, "...and reap the limitless rewards of
        unlocked customer value."
      </p>

      <p>
        The ISVs products could no longer compete with the
        free, yet never quite completely functionally
        complete products of the dark one. And this is why
        they have passed away into dust. No matter how good
        your product is, you cannot compete with free. And
        after all the ISVs were interred in their tombs,
        the armies of the ad revenue modelers attacked.
      </p>

      <p>
        And this is how we have come to where we are. A
        million dazzling apps which promise productivity,
        but deliver advertising impressions. An industry
        that depends on "innovation" and "bold new
        features" to entice us into the next, best
        product. Software developers working on "live"
        releases, where user features are delivered without
        road-map, schedule or even design.
      </p>

      <p>
        What will the future hold? Only time will tell.
