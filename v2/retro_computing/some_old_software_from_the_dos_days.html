    <title>Some Old Software From the DOS Days</title>

    <section>
      
      <p>
        I've always been interested in the development of
        programming languages and programmers' tools. Like
        many children of the 70's and 80's, I cut my teeth
        on Commodore 64s & TI 99/4's. But most of my income
        from the late 80's and early 90's came from DOS
        programming. After spending time on VMS, Unix,
        Xerox Altos, Apple Lisas and Macintoshes in school,
        coming back to work on DOS seemed like a step
        backwards.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the one thing I miss about DOS was the control
        you had over the machine. You didn't need to learn
        any fancy windowing APIs or worry about HTTP
        requests. If you wanted to get input from the user,
        you poked characters directly into video memory and
        installed your own keyboard interrupt handlers.
      </p>

      <p>
        After battling "real" operating systems recently, I
        found myself nostalgic for the old days. So I found
        my backup copy of Turbo Assembler 2.0 and installed
        it into a local <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DosBox</a>
        instance. If you want to do the same, you can find
        PDF copies of the manuals from the Internet Archive
        at:
      </p>

        <li><a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_borlandturugger2.0UsersGuide1990_14115184">Turbo Assembler 2.0 Users' Guide</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_borlandturembler2.0QuickReference1990_5083972">Turbo Assembler 2.0 Quick Reference Guide</a></li>

      </ul>

      <p>
        In related news, Borland released early versions of
        Turbo C & Turbo Pascal in the early 2000's. If
        you're interested in a little developer user
        experience archaeology, you can download some of
        these packages after a free registration:

      </ul>

      <p>
        I still have my Turbo C 2.0 floppies, but it was
        easier to download the package from the net. And
        while I was at the Internet Archive, I noticed they
        had a copy of Herb Schildt's "Using Turbo C" (which
        was the second book about C programming I bought,
        after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080321065315/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/">the K&R book</a>.)
      </p>

      </ul>

      <p>
        So if you're interested in the development of
        computer programming interfaces (and old DOS APIs)
        this should give you a good start.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's hard to do anything interesting with MS-DOS
        without knowing a bit about the PC
        architecture. The good people at Trailing Edge have
        archived the PC BIOS API reference; this should
        provide a decent reference to using BIOS functions
        with Turbo Assembler (or in-lined assembly language
        in Turbo C.)
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/ibm/pc/ps2/PS2_and_PC_BIOS_Interface_Technical_Reference_Apr87.pdf">IBM PS/2 & PC BIOS Interface Technical Reference</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To access file system and DOS device driver
        features, you need to be familiar with MS-DOS API
        Calls (aka Int 21h services.) The reference I used
        was Ray Duncan's Advanced MS-DOS Programming. It's
        likely out of print, but a google search found
        several "unofficial" copies of the text. For a
        legitimate copy, you may be able to find on on
        Amazon or eBay:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-MS-DOS-Programming-Microsoft-Programmers/dp/1556151578">Advanced MS-DOS Programming: The Microsoft Guide for Assembly Language & C Programmers</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        And if you still have questions, you can look at
        the source code for early versions of
        MS-DOS. Microsoft published the source code for
        MS-DOS v1.1 and v2.0. They're not released under an
        "open source" license, but the license is liberal
        enough to allow research and personal
        experimentation. Even if you don't want to download
        the source, take a look at the link anyway, there's
        a decent discussion of the early history of DOS:

      </ul>

      <p>
        In 2001, Dr. Dobbs published the PDF version of
        Michael Abrash's Graphics Programming Black Book
        for free. (free! w00t!) Abrash is considered one of
        (if not the) best authorities on x86 optimization
        and PC graphics programming. Reading this book is
        definitely time well spent.
