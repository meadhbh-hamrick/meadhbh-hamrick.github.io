        I have to admit, I am a fan of retro-computing. I
        have a real-live TRS-80 Model 100s and a Canon Cat
        I use on a daily basis. Elsewhere in the house I
        have a Apple //c, Tomy Tutor and a TI CC-40 I fire
        up when I'm getting especially nostalgic. And lets
        not talk about the Commodore 64, Classic Mac, Atari
        and Apple ][ emulators. I still find time to fire
        up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_(emulator)">Stella</a>
        and play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitfall!">PitFall!</a>
        or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_(1980_video_game)>Adventure</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, I wouldn't dream of doing without a
        system that can run a modern web browser or load a
        modern steam game. Flitting between email, twitter,
        skype, google+ and whatever calendar app I have
        open at the moment is an essential part of my work
        flow.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I've been thinking recently how much more
        satisfying old computers were. Not that new
        computers are bad, just that I (and most people I
        know) view them as appliances, not as objets d'art
        or artifacts of a trans-formative future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Old home computers generally had much more
        primitive programming systems. But this was more
        than compensated for by the ability of one or two
        people to write a complete commercial
        program. Capabilities were a little lower, but so
        were expectations. In the pre-Windows / pre-Unix
        era, programmers were responsible for writing
        complete systems. DOS was effectively an extended
        boot manager, adding just enough functionality to
        get you into one of a couple of different
        applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course now we have a hundred variations of
        language bindings for on-machine APIs and you're
        not a real web API unless you have two versions,
        one of which changes randomly, with little warning
        and in undocumented ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just recently I remembered one aspect of the
        pre-Windows era. Virtually everything was
        single-task. Sure, you could have a hard drive with
        a bazillion games on it. But only one of them was
        active at any given time. If you wanted to play a
        game, you played the game to the exclusion of other
        tasks until you were finished.
      </p>

      <p>
        You didn't have your email & twitter windows open
        in the background as you waited for that important
        message from your spouse. Your attention could not
        be diverted from the task at hand, because the
        operating system was incapable of running
        background tasks to distract you.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a charter member of the ADHD Programmers' Club,
        I'm starting to remember how productive I used to
        be. When I was at work, I didn't have a copy of
        Jewel Maze 4 open in the background; I had the
        Turbo C IDE open. Because that was my job. When I
        got home, that's when I launched a copy of Sundog
        or Elite (or Zork or ...)
      </p>

      <p>
        And I wonder... should we go back to that?
      </p>

      <p>
        Donald Knuth, the "father of algorithms," <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html">famously
        does not use email</a>. Why should he? It's a
        distraction. I keep thinking... If someone like Don
        Knuth doesn't use email, then maybe I can get away
        with checking my email once in the morning and once
        in the evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure. There are plenty of times when emergencies
        come up, but maybe you should be phoning or texting
        me when that happens.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also LOVE the idea of a little bug on the screen
        giving you a 15 minute heads up before meetings or
        pre-scheduled phone calls. And I want to have a
        Skype-like digital phone system open in the
        background so I can have a note-taking app running
        in front of me.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I'm wondering is... can we... should we go
        back to a "virtual cartridge" system where our user
        interface <em>isn't</em> a bunch of overlapping
        windows, but one big ol' app in the middle of the
        screen, a clock icon and an emergency alerts icon.
      </p>

      <p>
        The user experience would be press the big CHANGE
        APP button on the keyboard and your whole screen
        shows the app picker. From there you use the
        keyboard to search or browse your app collection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway. Just an idea.
