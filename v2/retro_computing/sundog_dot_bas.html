    <title>SUNDOG.BAS - How We Made Adventure Games in BASIC</title>

    <section>
      
      <p>
        In the old days all we had was BASIC and Assembly
        Language. Sure, you could get the p-system and
        write software in Pascal. And you could write
        programs in LOGO for the Apple II, Atari 8-bits and
        the TI 99/4. But if you wanted people to use your
        software, you wrote it to run on systems people
        actually owned. In the early 80's, that meant you
        wrote in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly
        Language</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now don't get me wrong, BASIC isn't the world's
        greatest language for software development. But it
        was easy to implement on 8-bit microcomputers, a
        LOT easier than Assembly and there were plenty of
        books around to teach kids how to use it. Every now
        and again <a href="in_defense_of_basic.html">I wax
        poetic about BASIC</a>; usually the feeling passes
        quickly, but every now and again I get motivated to
        revisit the past.
      </p>

      <p>
        This text is a simple description of how Jason
        Grigsby and I pieced together our own text
        adventure games in 1982 and 1983. BASIC has a
        deservedly bad reputation in serious software
        circles, but you can actually structure programs
        reasonably. Old-school BASIC offered very little
        support for real data structures or advanced
        programming technique, but that didn't mean you
        couldn't make a reasonably well structured program.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that's what I'm trying to do here: document how
        we made a BASIC program that didn't suck.
      </p>

      <p>
        The program I'm presenting here is a reconstruction
        of a program I wrote in 1983 for the TI 99/4 and
        the Commodore 64. In the late 70's, I noticed the
        Byte Shop down the street was selling software in
        plastic baggies with xeroxed manuals. I figured it
        was easy enough to write an adventure game. Even if
        I couldn't sell it at the Byte Shop, I could use it
        as an example of my programming prowess.
      </p>

      <p>
        "SUNDOG" was an idea I got from playing too much
        <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/80206/CTG02Snapshot">Snapshot</a>
        as a kid and looking over Jason's shoulder
        while he played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starcross_(video_game)">Infocom's Starcross</a>
        game. It's completely unrelated to the game "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunDog:_Frozen_Legacy">Sundog
        : Frozen Legacy</a>" -- I came up with the name at
        least a year before that game was released, though
        dang, FTL made a MUCH better game than I did. This
        version of SUNDOG casts the player as the sole
        survivor of an accident aboard the Scout Ship
        Sundog. You must work out how to escape your
        crippled ship and signal the core systems for a
        rescue.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUNDOG was broken down into three parts: escape the
        dying scout ship, retrieve the air raft from the
        alien derelict and figure out how to power the
        ship's ansible to call for a rescue. Each of these
        three parts was implemented as a separate basic
        program. For simplicity's sake, I'm only
        documenting the first part here. The second and
        third parts are implemented with almost entirely
        the same core code, it's just the DATA statements
        that describe objects, etc. are changed. To the
        right is a map of all the locations in the first
        part of the game.The original program is lost to
        humanity, but I remember it's structure well enough
        to reconstruct it. The version presented here
        targets <a href="http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/">Chipmunk
        BASIC</a> which should run on MacOS-X
        and Linux. If you want to run this program, you'll
        need to install BASIC before continuing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also assume you know what a text adventure game
        is (also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction">Interactive
        Fiction</a>.) Click over to the Wikipedia article
        if you're unfamiliar with this class of game
        programs.
      </p>

      <h2>Theory of Operation, Part I - Using String Arrays for
        Virtually Everything</h2>

      <p>
        Classic BASIC isn't well known for
it's support for data structures. But it does support
arrays; most BASICs from the late 70's even support string
arrays. So you could do something like this:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  10 DIM A$(3)
  20 A$(0) = "HELLO"
  30 A$(1) = "WORLD"
  40 A$(2) = "GOOD TO SEE YOU!"
  50 FOR I = 0 TO 2 : PRINT A$(I) : NEXT I</pre>

      <p>
        This small program should emit the following
        output:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  HELLO
  WORLD
  GOOD TO SEE YOU!</pre>

      <p>
        We use this feature of BASIC to hold all our data
        about commands, directions, objects and locations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's take a look at some code from SUNDOG.BAS; in
        this excerpt, we're using a READ command to read
        the directions we want to support into a string
        array called D$. The number of directions is stored
        in DC.
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  12000 REM READ DC And D$ Array
  12010 RESTORE 32010
  12020 READ DC
  12030 DIM D$(DC)
  12040 FOR I = 0 TO DC - 1 : READ D$(I) : NEXT I
  32000 REM DIRECTIONS ON THE SHIP
  32010 DATA 4
  32020 DATA "FORE","STARBOARD","AFT","PORT"</pre>

      <p>
        This code fragment first RESTORE's the read pointer
        to line 32010, reads the number of directions as
        DC, uses the DIM command to dimension a 4 element
        string array and then reads each direction into one
        of the array elements. After running this code, the
        following fragment would print out the four
        directions:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  FOR I = 0 TO DC : PRINT D$(I) : NEXT I</pre>

      <p>
        If you look at the source code for SUNDOG.BAS,
        you'll see that we do the same thing for objects,
        locations and commands.
      </p>

      <h2>Theory of Operation, Part II - Room Descriptions
      and Adjacency</h2>

      <p>
        If you look at code, you'll see we're doing
        something funky with room descriptions; we're
        adding a bunch of numbers to each of room
        description (I'm modifying it slightly for this
        example):
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  32030 REM LOCATIONS IN THE SHIP
  32040 DATA 4
  32050 DATA "Galley"
  32051 DATA "This is the ship's galley, where the crew
  make their meals. The Captain's stateroom is fore, 
  your bunk is to the starboard and the engineer's
  quarters are aft."
  32052 DATA 1,2,3,-1
  32060 DATA "Captain's Stateroom"
  32061 DATA "Barely larger than a walk-in closet, the
  Captain's Stateroom is what passes for luxury on a
  scout ship. A porthole to starboard reveals inky
  blackness beyond while a door to the galley is aft."
  32062 DATA -1,-1,0,-1
  32070 DATA "Navigator's Bunk"
  32071 DATA "This is your bunk, stuffed into a pantry
  adjacent to the galley. A flimsy door to port opens to
  the galley beyond."
  32080 DATA "Engineer's Quarters"
  32081 DATA "While not exactly luxurious, the
  engineer's quarters are large enough for a desk and a
  regular bed."
  32082 DATA 0,-1,-1,-1</pre>

      <p>
        The numbers in lines 32052, 32062, 32072 and 32082
        are "adjacency indices." They tell you which room
        is in which direction from the current room. In
        SUNDOG, we have four directions you can travel:
        FORE, STARBOARD, AFT and PORT. The adjacency
        indices tell you which room you'll wind up in if
        you go in that direction. The directions are
        ordered and so are the indices. If you go FORE from
        the Galley, you'll wind up in room number 1, the
        Captain's Stateroom. If you go STARBOARD, you'll
        wind up in room 2, the Navigator's Bunk. You can't
        go PORT from the Galley, so that entry has a -1
        (which means "you can't go this way.")
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's the code that reads the locations into the
        L$ string array and the A adjacency array:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  12060 REM READ LC, L$, LD$ and A arrays
  12070 RESTORE 32040
  12080 READ LC 12090 DIM L$(LC),LD$(LC),A(LC*DC)
  12100 FOR I = 0 TO LC - 1
  12110 READ L$(I),LD$(I)
  12120 FOR J = 0 TO DC - 1
  12130 READ A(I*DC+J)
  12140 NEXT J
  12150 NEXT I</pre>

      <p>
        Note that we're storing the adjacency indexes in a
        one dimensional array. I did this because it's easy
        enough to convert from a location / direction pair
        to a single index and I was worried I would want to
        port the program to a BASIC that didn't support two
        dimensional arrays.
      </p>

      <p>
        We'll look at how we move from location to location a
        little later.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Theory of Operation, Part III - Objects</h2>

      <p>
        What's an adventure game without the ability to
        pick up a lantern, swing a sword or read a secret
        book? (Or in the case of SUNDOG, put on a Vacc
        Suit?)
      </p>

      <p>
        Objects in SUNDOG are initialized the same way as
        Locations and Directions, but with a little extra
        meta-data. Objects are implemented as the O$ string
        array which contains their name: Keycard, Vaccsuit,
        Wrench, etc. There's a separate array, OL which
        lists each object's location. There's also a OF
        array that lists each object's flags.
      </p>

      <p>
        Given the examples above, you can probably guess
        how we initialized the various object related
        arrays, so I'll leave it up to you to dig into the
        source if you're interested. Instead, let's talk
        about locations of objects. Each object is
        initialized with a default location, stored in the
        OL array. Locations greater than or equal to zero
        correspond to a location (like what's described in
        the L$ string array.) An item whose location is
        less than zero is *INSIDE* another object (not in a
        location.) The absolute value of the location is
        the object it's inside. A location of -32768 means
        the object has disappeared. If it's -32767, then
        the object is in your inventory.
      </p>

      <p>
Here's a code snippet that will tell you where things are:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  100 FOR I = 0 TO OC - 1
  110 PRINT I;" ";O$(I);" ";
  120 IF OL(I) >= 0 THEN 210
  130 IF OL(I) = -32767 THEN 190
  140 IF OL(I) = -32768 THEN 170
  150 PRINT "IN OBJECT "; O$(ABS(OL(I)))
  160 GOTO 220
  170 PRINT "DISAPPEARED"
  180 GOTO 220
  190 PRINT "IN INVENTORY"
  200 GOTO 220
  210 PRINT "IN LOCATION "; L$(OL(I))
  220 NEXT I</pre>

      <p>
        But what about the flags? What the heck are they?
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where it gets a little bit tricky. Objects
        aren't just things you can pick up and carry with
        you. Objects are also things you can interact with
        linguistically. If I typed the command "OPEN
        DRAWER," I need the parser to understand that the
        drawer is something you can open but at the same
        time it's not something you can take. So each
        object has a set of flags stored as a bit field in
        the OF array:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
  0x01 - Viewable  - they'll show up in a room's
                     description
  0x02 - Takeable  - you can take/drop this object
  0x04 - Openable  - you can open or close this object
  0x08 - Opened    - is this object currently open?
  0x10 - Container - you can PUT things inside this
                     object if it's open.
  0x20 - Lockable  - you can lock this object
  0x40 - Locked    - it's currently locked</pre>

      <p>
        Continuing the drawer example, the drawer would
        have flags of 0x14 because it starts the game
        closed, it *IS* openable, you can't take it and it
        isn't listed as an object in the room.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Doing Interesting Things, Part I - Parsing the Command Line</h2>

      <p>
        SUNDOG understands five command formats:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>VERB - LOOK, INVENTORY, etc.</li>
        <li>VERB SUBJECT - GET KEYCARD, DROP TETHER, CLOSE DRAWER, etc.</li>
        <li>VERB MODIFIER SUBJECT - PRESS RED BUTTON</li>
        <li>VERB SUBJECT PREPOSITION OBJECT - PUT TETHER IN DRAWER</li>
        <li>VERB MODIFIER SUBJECT PREPOSITION OBJECT - PUT GREEN KEYCARD IN DRAWER</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Since the format and interpretation of words in a
        command are dependent on the number of words in a
        command, it's relatively easy to parse commands.
      </p>

      <p>
        SUNDOG uses C$ to hold the unparsed command line;
        after it is parsed, each element of the the N$()
        string array holds one word of the command. Here's
        what the parser looks like:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  100 NC = 5 : DIM N$(NC)
  110 C$="PUT RED KEYCARD IN DRAWER"
  120 S = 1 : K = 0
  130 E = INSTR(C$," ",S)
  140 IF E <> 0 THEN GOTO 180
  150 N$(K)=MID$(C$,S,LEN(C$))
  160 K = K + 1
  170 GOTO 230
  180 N$(K)=MID$(C$,S,E-S)
  190 S=E+1
  200 K = K + 1
  210 IF K >= NC THEN 230
  220 GOTO 130
  230 FOR J = 0 TO K - 1 : PRINT J;" ";N$(J) : NEXT J</pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Doing Interesting Things, Part II - Where Am I?</h2>

      <p>
        Before we ask the user for a command, we print out
        where we are. Most text oriented games of this era
        were smart enough to not split words between
        lines. Writing the code for that is a little more
        work than I was interested in doing, so i
        pre-formatted descriptions of locations. In the
        code I'm writing here, I'm assuming you have a 60
        by 16 character screen, mostly to ensure it fits on
        my TRS-80 Model I. If I port this to a Commodore
        64, VIC-20 or TI-99/4, I'll have to reformat the
        text.
      </p>

      <p>
        Text adventure games from the '80s would normally
        only display a full description of a location the
        first time you visit it. After that, you use the
        LOOK command to see what's there. I use a bit field
        in an array of integers to store whether or not
        you've visited a particular location.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the beginning of the program, we create an array
        N integers long where N is the number of rooms
        divided by the size of an integer (some BASICs have
        16 bit integers, others store integers as floating
        point numbers, which complicates things.)
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  100 REM LC - Number of Locations (i.e.- Location Count)
  110 REM BPI - Bits Per Integer
  120 REM VC - Size of the "visited" array
  130 REM V() - Visited array
  140 LC = 20 : BPI = 15 : VC = INT( LC / BPI ) + 1 : DIM V( VC )
  150 END
  1000 REM SUBROUTINE: SET ROOM AS VISITED
  1010 REM INPUT: L = ROOM TO VISIT
  1020 I = INT( L / BPI )
  1030 J = L - ( I * BPI )
  1040 V(I) = V(I) OR ( 2 ^ J )
  1050 RETURN
  1100 REM SUBROUTINE: Visited? Set's K to 1 if this location's been visited.
  1110 I = INT( L / BPV )
  1120 J = L - I * BPV
  1130 IF ( V(I) AND 2^J ) = 0 THEN K=0 ELSE K=1
  1140 RETURN</pre>

      <p>
        So each time through the main loop, we would call
        the routine at 1100 with L being the current
        location. If K is 1, then that means we've been
        there before and we shouldn't print the full
        location description. Then we call the routine in
        1000 to set the location as being visited.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also need to print out what items are in the
        room. For this we simply loop through all the
        objects we know about and see if their location is
        the same as our current location:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">

  1200 REM SUBROUTINE: PRINT ITEMS IN THIS ROOM
  1210 PRINT "ITEMS HERE:"
  1220 J = 0
  1230 FOR I = 0 TO OC - 1
  1230   IF OL(I) <> L THEN GOTO 1270
  1240   IF OF(I) AND 1 = 0 THEN GOTO 1270
  1250   PRINT O$(I)
  1260   J = J + 1
  1270 NEXT I
  1280 IF J <> 0 THEN GOTO 1300 
  1290 PRINT "*NO ITEMS HERE*"
  1300 RETURN</pre>
    </section>

      <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

      <p>
        You now have enough to hobble together a simple
        interactive fiction. The SUNDOG story required a
        few more commands dealing with putting on the
        VaccSuit and exiting the Scout Ship Sundog, but you
        can easily reverse engineer what I did by looking
        at the code; the major structure is as defined
        above.
