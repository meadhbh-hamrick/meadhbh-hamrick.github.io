      Hello. Welcome to my web site. If you're trying
      to get ahold of me, see the
      <a href="about.html">About the Author Page</a>.
      If  you're
      wondering why my site is so plain, check out the
      <a href="v2/design/why_is_my_web_site_so_plain.html">Why
        Is My Web Site So Plain?</a> page.

      <h2>Nano-Blog</h2>
      <p>
        Not a blog. Not a micro-blog. More like a
        <a href="v2/blag/index.html">nano-blog</a>. For
        when a full page of Meadhbh is too much.

      <h2>Technical</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="v2/technical/index.html">Technical
        Documents</a> section is where you'll find
        articles I've written about technology.  If you
        know I wrote something technical and don't have
        the link, this is a decent place to start
        looking.

      <h2>Fiction</h2>
      <p>
        While most of my income comes from technical
        projects, I <i>am</i> a published author of
        literary fiction. You can find some of my stories
        here in the <a href="v2/fiction/index.html">Fiction
        Corner</a>.

    <section id="05_Non_Fiction">
      <h2>Non-Fiction</h2>
      <p>
        I also write non-technical non-fiction, mostly
        about my time abroad. You can find it in the
        <a href="v2/non_fiction/index.html">Non-Fiction
        Section</a>.

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        Design is not my main gig. I don't make a living
        from my design sense. But the older I get, the
        more I've realized how much the study of design
        is important to just about any job. I spend most
        of my life in front of a computer, so I have
        ideas of how they should work. In the
        <a href="v2/design/index.html">Design Section</a>
        you can see some Computer-Human Interface
        design's I've hobbled together.

      <h2>Retrocomputing</h2>
      <p>
        Once, everything was new. You woke up one day
        thinking you knew how the world worked and
        somewhere along the way something happened that
        changed everything. In the late 1970s and early
        1980s, this happened a lot for computer
        enthusiasts. In the <a href="v2/retro_computing/index.html">Retrocomputing
        Section</a> I've collected a few stories about
        living in a time before computing hardware was
        ubiquitous.
