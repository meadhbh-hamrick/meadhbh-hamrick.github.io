    <p>
      Hello. Welcome to my personal web page. It's
      a bit plain to look at, but rich in content. Please
      see <a href="design/why_my_web_page_is_so_plain.html">Why
      My Web Page Is So Plain</a> if you're curious why
      I eschew modern styling.

      <dd>
        I spent a couple years working in the RISC-V
        world. Most of the people who inhabit it are
        pretty serious computer architecture nerds. A
        year ago I started writing articles about RISC-V
        for people who haven't taken Patterson's
        Computer Architecture class at Berkeley.

      <dd>
        Programmers do the strangest things. This is a
        series I wrote to highlight some of the weird
        things I've seen in code along with explanations
        about why they may not be so weird.

        While most of my income comes from technical
        projects, I <i>am</i> a published author of
        literary fiction. You can find some of my stories
        here.

        I also write non-technical non-fiction.

      <dt><a href="technical/index.html">Technical</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Most of why people come here is to see the
        technical things I write.

      <dt><a href="retrocomputing/index.html">Retro-Computing</a></dt>
      <dd>
        I like old computers. And sometimes write about
        them.
