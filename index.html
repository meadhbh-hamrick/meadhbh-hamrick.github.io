      Hello. Welcome to my web site. If you're trying
      to get ahold of me, see the
      <a href="about.html">About the Author Page</a>.
      If  you're
      wondering why my site is so plain, check out the
      <a href="v2/design/why_is_my_web_site_so_plain.html">Why
        Is My Web Site So Plain?</a> page.

    <section id="01_Popular">
      <h2><a href="popular.html">Popular Pages</a></h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="popular.html">Popular Pages</a>
        page lists the top five popular pages on my
        site.  It's worth checking out if you believe in
        the wisdom of crowds. But I sometimes disagree
        with the popular will, so I have a curated
        "<a href="bestof.html">Best Ofâ€¦</a>" page where
        I list what I think should be popular.

    <section id="02_RISCV">
      <h2><a href="v2/technical/riscv/index.html">Understanding RISC-V</a></h2>
      <p>
        And this is getting popular enough that I'm
        putting it up at the top-level page.
        I spent a couple years working in the RISC-V
        world. Most of the people who inhabit it are
        pretty serious computer architecture nerds. A
        year ago I started writing
        <a href="v2/technical/riscv/index.html">articles
          about RISC-V</a>
        for people who haven't taken Patterson's
        Computer Architecture class at Berkeley.

      <h2><a href="v2/technical/index.html">Technical</a></h2>
      <p>
        This is a link to <i>all</i> my technical
        writing, not just the popular bits. If you know
        I wrote something and don't have the link, this
        is a decent place to start looking.

      <h2><a href="v2/fictionindex.html">Fiction</a></h2>
      <p>
        While most of my income comes from technical
        projects, I <i>am</i> a published author of
        literary fiction. You can find some of my stories
        here.

      <p>
        I also write non-technical non-fiction, mostly
        about my time abroad.
