    <h1>Meadhbh Hamrick's Web Page</h1>

    <p>
      Hello. Welcome to my web page. If you're trying to
      get ahold of me, see the
      <a href="about.html">About the Author Page</a>. If you're
      wondering why my site is so plain, check out the
      <a href="design/why_my_web_page_is_so_plain.html">Why
        My Web Page Is So Plain</a> page.

        The <a href="popular.html">Popular Pages</a>
        page lists the top five popular pages on my site.
        It's worth checking out if you believe in the
        wisdom of crowds.

        What other people think is intersting and what I
        think <i>should</i> be popular turn out to be two
        different things. Check out the
        <a href="what_should_be_popular.html">What
        Should Be Popular</a> page to see what I think
        is the good quality content that <i>should</i>
        appeal to a wide audience.

        And this is getting popular enough that I'm
        putting it up at the top-level page.
        I spent a couple years working in the RISC-V
        world. Most of the people who inhabit it are
        pretty serious computer architecture nerds. A
        year ago I started writing
        <a href="technical/riscv/index.html">articles
          about RISC-V</a>
        for people who haven't taken Patterson's
        Computer Architecture class at Berkeley.

        I like old computers and I sometimes write about
        them. Looking at old computing hardware and old
        user experiences gives you an understanding of
        how we got to where we are. I think it's
        important to understand this kind of thing.

      <dt><a href="technical/programmer/index.html">Strange Programmer Habits</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Programmers do the strangest things. This is a
        series I wrote to highlight some of the weird
        things I've seen in code along with explanations
        about why they may not be so weird.

      <dt><a href="technical/vwrap/index.html">What is VWRAP?</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Many years ago I worked for Linden-Lab, makers of
        Second Life&trade;. As part of my work, we
        published some of the protocols used to implement
        that virtual world. Some were published as part
        of the Virtual Worlds Region Agent Protocol
        Working Group. I <i>still</i> think the documents
        we wrote were interesting, even though no one
        currently uses them. This part of my web page
        describes the history of the VWRAP working group
        and what it was trying to accomplish.

      <dd>
        While most of my income comes from technical
        projects, I <i>am</i> a published author of
        literary fiction. You can find some of my stories
        here.
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="non_fiction/index.html">Non-Fiction</a></dt>
      <dd>
        I also write non-technical non-fiction.

      <dd>
        This is a link to <i>all</i> my technical
        writing, not just the popular bits. If you know
        I wrote something and don't have the link, this
        is a decent place to start looking.
