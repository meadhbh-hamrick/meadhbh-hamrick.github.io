      Hello. Welcome to my web site. If you're trying
      to get ahold of me, see the
      <a href="about.html">About the Author Page</a>.
      If  you're
      wondering why my site is so plain, check out the
      <a href="v2/design/why_is_my_web_site_so_plain.html">Why
        Is My Web Site So Plain?</a> page.

    <section id="01_Popular">
      <h2>Popular Pages</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="popular.html">Popular Pages</a>
        page lists the top five popular pages on my
        site.  It's worth checking out if you believe in
        the wisdom of crowds. But I sometimes disagree
        with the popular will, so I have a curated
        "<a href="bestof.html">Best Ofâ€¦</a>" page where
        I list what I think should be popular.

    <section id="02_RISCV">
      <h2>Understanding RISC-V</h2>
      <p>
        And this is getting popular enough that I'm
        putting it up at the top-level page.
        I spent a couple years working in the RISC-V
        world. Most of the people who inhabit it are
        pretty serious computer architecture nerds. A
        year ago I started writing
        <a href="v2/technical/riscv/index.html">Byte-Sized
          RISC-V Bits</a>, a collection of short
        articles about RISC-V for people who haven't
        taken Patterson's Computer Architecture class at
        Berkeley.

      <h2>Technical</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="v2/technical/index.html">Technical
        Documents</a> section is where you'll find
        articles I've written about technology.  If you
        know I wrote something technical and don't have
        the link, this is a decent place to start
        looking.

      <h2>Fiction</h2>
      <p>
        While most of my income comes from technical
        projects, I <i>am</i> a published author of
        literary fiction. You can find some of my stories
        here in the <a href="v2/fiction/index.html">Fiction
        Corner</a>.

    <section id="05_Non_Fiction">
      <h2>Non-Fiction</h2>
      <p>
        I also write non-technical non-fiction, mostly
        about my time abroad. You can find it in the
        <a href="v2/non_fiction/index.html">Non-Fiction
        Section</a>.

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        Design is not my main gig. I don't make a living
        from my design sense. But the older I get, the
        more I've realized how much the study of design
        is important to just about any job. I spend most
        of my life in front of a computer, so I have
        ideas of how they should work. In the
        <a href="design/index.html">Design Section</a>
        you can see some Computer-Human Interface
        design's I've hobbled together.
