    <section id="00_Intro"><p>
      This is the section of my site where I keep things
      I've written about "Design" -- mostly that means
      graphic design on the web or in print, but I stray
      into information architecture a bit as well. If
      you're looking for pages about designing software,
      you'll find that over in the
      <a href="../technical/index.html">Technical
        Section</a>.

      <h2><a href="why_is_my_web_site_so_plain.html">Why Is My Web Site So Plain?</a></h2>
      <p>
        This site is pretty plain. There are no fancy
        fonts, very few images and mostly text. This
        isn't because I'm lazy, it's because most pages
        on the web are over-designed and distracting.
